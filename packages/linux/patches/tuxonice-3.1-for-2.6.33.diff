+		   TuxOnIce 3.0 Internal Documentation.
+			Updated to 26 March 2009
+
+1.  Introduction.
+
+    TuxOnIce 3.0 is an addition to the Linux Kernel, designed to
+    allow the user to quickly shutdown and quickly boot a computer, without
+    needing to close documents or programs. It is equivalent to the
+    hibernate facility in some laptops. This implementation, however,
+    requires no special BIOS or hardware support.
+
+    The code in these files is based upon the original implementation
+    prepared by Gabor Kuti and additional work by Pavel Machek and a
+    host of others. This code has been substantially reworked by Nigel
+    Cunningham, again with the help and testing of many others, not the
+    least of whom is Michael Frank. At its heart, however, the operation is
+    essentially the same as Gabor's version.
+
+2.  Overview of operation.
+
+    The basic sequence of operations is as follows:
+
+	a. Quiesce all other activity.
+	b. Ensure enough memory and storage space are available, and attempt
+	   to free memory/storage if necessary.
+	c. Allocate the required memory and storage space.
+	d. Write the image.
+	e. Power down.
+
+    There are a number of complicating factors which mean that things are
+    not as simple as the above would imply, however...
+
+    o The activity of each process must be stopped at a point where it will
+    not be holding locks necessary for saving the image, or unexpectedly
+    restart operations due to something like a timeout and thereby make
+    our image inconsistent.
+
+    o It is desirous that we sync outstanding I/O to disk before calculating
+    image statistics. This reduces corruption if one should suspend but
+    then not resume, and also makes later parts of the operation safer (see
+    below).
+
+    o We need to get as close as we can to an atomic copy of the data.
+    Inconsistencies in the image will result in inconsistent memory contents at
+    resume time, and thus in instability of the system and/or file system
+    corruption. This would appear to imply a maximum image size of one half of
+    the amount of RAM, but we have a solution... (again, below).
+
+    o In 2.6, we choose to play nicely with the other suspend-to-disk
+    implementations.
+
+3.  Detailed description of internals.
+
+    a. Quiescing activity.
+
+    Safely quiescing the system is achieved using three separate but related
+    aspects.
+
+    First, we note that the vast majority of processes don't need to run during
+    suspend. They can be 'frozen'. We therefore implement a refrigerator
+    routine, which processes enter and in which they remain until the cycle is
+    complete. Processes enter the refrigerator via try_to_freeze() invocations
+    at appropriate places.  A process cannot be frozen in any old place. It
+    must not be holding locks that will be needed for writing the image or
+    freezing other processes. For this reason, userspace processes generally
+    enter the refrigerator via the signal handling code, and kernel threads at
+    the place in their event loops where they drop locks and yield to other
+    processes or sleep.
+
+    The task of freezing processes is complicated by the fact that there can be
+    interdependencies between processes. Freezing process A before process B may
+    mean that process B cannot be frozen, because it stops at waiting for
+    process A rather than in the refrigerator. This issue is seen where
+    userspace waits on freezeable kernel threads or fuse filesystem threads. To
+    address this issue, we implement the following algorithm for quiescing
+    activity:
+
+	- Freeze filesystems (including fuse - userspace programs starting
+		new requests are immediately frozen; programs already running
+		requests complete their work before being frozen in the next
+		step)
+	- Freeze userspace
+	- Thaw filesystems (this is safe now that userspace is frozen and no
+		fuse requests are outstanding).
+	- Invoke sys_sync (noop on fuse).
+	- Freeze filesystems
+	- Freeze kernel threads
+
+    If we need to free memory, we thaw kernel threads and filesystems, but not
+    userspace. We can then free caches without worrying about deadlocks due to
+    swap files being on frozen filesystems or such like.
+
+    b. Ensure enough memory & storage are available.
+
+    We have a number of constraints to meet in order to be able to successfully
+    suspend and resume.
+
+    First, the image will be written in two parts, described below. One of these
+    parts needs to have an atomic copy made, which of course implies a maximum
+    size of one half of the amount of system memory. The other part ('pageset')
+    is not atomically copied, and can therefore be as large or small as desired.
+
+    Second, we have constraints on the amount of storage available. In these
+    calculations, we may also consider any compression that will be done. The
+    cryptoapi module allows the user to configure an expected compression ratio.
+
+    Third, the user can specify an arbitrary limit on the image size, in
+    megabytes. This limit is treated as a soft limit, so that we don't fail the
+    attempt to suspend if we cannot meet this constraint.
+
+    c. Allocate the required memory and storage space.
+
+    Having done the initial freeze, we determine whether the above constraints
+    are met, and seek to allocate the metadata for the image. If the constraints
+    are not met, or we fail to allocate the required space for the metadata, we
+    seek to free the amount of memory that we calculate is needed and try again.
+    We allow up to four iterations of this loop before aborting the cycle. If we
+    do fail, it should only be because of a bug in TuxOnIce's calculations.
+
+    These steps are merged together in the prepare_image function, found in
+    prepare_image.c. The functions are merged because of the cyclical nature
+    of the problem of calculating how much memory and storage is needed. Since
+    the data structures containing the information about the image must
+    themselves take memory and use storage, the amount of memory and storage
+    required changes as we prepare the image. Since the changes are not large,
+    only one or two iterations will be required to achieve a solution.
+
+    The recursive nature of the algorithm is miminised by keeping user space
+    frozen while preparing the image, and by the fact that our records of which
+    pages are to be saved and which pageset they are saved in use bitmaps (so
+    that changes in number or fragmentation of the pages to be saved don't
+    feedback via changes in the amount of memory needed for metadata). The
+    recursiveness is thus limited to any extra slab pages allocated to store the
+    extents that record storage used, and the effects of seeking to free memory.
+
+    d. Write the image.
+
+    We previously mentioned the need to create an atomic copy of the data, and
+    the half-of-memory limitation that is implied in this. This limitation is
+    circumvented by dividing the memory to be saved into two parts, called
+    pagesets.
+
+    Pageset2 contains most of the page cache - the pages on the active and
+    inactive LRU lists that aren't needed or modified while TuxOnIce is
+    running, so they can be safely written without an atomic copy. They are
+    therefore saved first and reloaded last. While saving these pages,
+    TuxOnIce carefully ensures that the work of writing the pages doesn't make
+    the image inconsistent. With the support for Kernel (Video) Mode Setting
+    going into the kernel at the time of writing, we need to check for pages
+    on the LRU that are used by KMS, and exclude them from pageset2. They are
+    atomically copied as part of pageset 1.
+
+    Once pageset2 has been saved, we prepare to do the atomic copy of remaining
+    memory. As part of the preparation, we power down drivers, thereby providing
+    them with the opportunity to have their state recorded in the image. The
+    amount of memory allocated by drivers for this is usually negligible, but if
+    DRI is in use, video drivers may require significants amounts. Ideally we
+    would be able to query drivers while preparing the image as to the amount of
+    memory they will need. Unfortunately no such mechanism exists at the time of
+    writing. For this reason, TuxOnIce allows the user to set an
+    'extra_pages_allowance', which is used to seek to ensure sufficient memory
+    is available for drivers at this point. TuxOnIce also lets the user set this
+    value to 0. In this case, a test driver suspend is done while preparing the
+    image, and the difference (plus a margin) used instead. TuxOnIce will also
+    automatically restart the hibernation process (twice at most) if it finds
+    that the extra pages allowance is not sufficient. It will then use what was
+    actually needed (plus a margin, again). Failure to hibernate should thus
+    be an extremely rare occurence.
+
+    Having suspended the drivers, we save the CPU context before making an
+    atomic copy of pageset1, resuming the drivers and saving the atomic copy.
+    After saving the two pagesets, we just need to save our metadata before
+    powering down.
+
+    As we mentioned earlier, the contents of pageset2 pages aren't needed once
+    they've been saved. We therefore use them as the destination of our atomic
+    copy. In the unlikely event that pageset1 is larger, extra pages are
+    allocated while the image is being prepared. This is normally only a real
+    possibility when the system has just been booted and the page cache is
+    small.
+
+    This is where we need to be careful about syncing, however. Pageset2 will
+    probably contain filesystem meta data. If this is overwritten with pageset1
+    and then a sync occurs, the filesystem will be corrupted - at least until
+    resume time and another sync of the restored data. Since there is a
+    possibility that the user might not resume or (may it never be!) that
+    TuxOnIce might oops, we do our utmost to avoid syncing filesystems after
+    copying pageset1.
+
+    e. Power down.
+
+    Powering down uses standard kernel routines. TuxOnIce supports powering down
+    using the ACPI S3, S4 and S5 methods or the kernel's non-ACPI power-off.
+    Supporting suspend to ram (S3) as a power off option might sound strange,
+    but it allows the user to quickly get their system up and running again if
+    the battery doesn't run out (we just need to re-read the overwritten pages)
+    and if the battery does run out (or the user removes power), they can still
+    resume.
+
+4.  Data Structures.
+
+    TuxOnIce uses three main structures to store its metadata and configuration
+    information:
+
+    a) Pageflags bitmaps.
+
+    TuxOnIce records which pages will be in pageset1, pageset2, the destination
+    of the atomic copy and the source of the atomically restored image using
+    bitmaps. The code used is that written for swsusp, with small improvements
+    to match TuxOnIce's requirements.
+
+    The pageset1 bitmap is thus easily stored in the image header for use at
+    resume time.
+
+    As mentioned above, using bitmaps also means that the amount of memory and
+    storage required for recording the above information is constant. This
+    greatly simplifies the work of preparing the image. In earlier versions of
+    TuxOnIce, extents were used to record which pages would be stored. In that
+    case, however, eating memory could result in greater fragmentation of the
+    lists of pages, which in turn required more memory to store the extents and
+    more storage in the image header. These could in turn require further
+    freeing of memory, and another iteration. All of this complexity is removed
+    by having bitmaps.
+
+    Bitmaps also make a lot of sense because TuxOnIce only ever iterates
+    through the lists. There is therefore no cost to not being able to find the
+    nth page in order 0 time. We only need to worry about the cost of finding
+    the n+1th page, given the location of the nth page. Bitwise optimisations
+    help here.
+
+    b) Extents for block data.
+
+    TuxOnIce supports writing the image to multiple block devices. In the case
+    of swap, multiple partitions and/or files may be in use, and we happily use
+    them all (with the exception of compcache pages, which we allocate but do
+    not use). This use of multiple block devices is accomplished as follows:
+
+    Whatever the actual source of the allocated storage, the destination of the
+    image can be viewed in terms of one or more block devices, and on each
+    device, a list of sectors. To simplify matters, we only use contiguous,
+    PAGE_SIZE aligned sectors, like the swap code does.
+
+    Since sector numbers on each bdev may well not start at 0, it makes much
+    more sense to use extents here. Contiguous ranges of pages can thus be
+    represented in the extents by contiguous values.
+
+    Variations in block size are taken account of in transforming this data
+    into the parameters for bio submission.
+
+    We can thus implement a layer of abstraction wherein the core of TuxOnIce
+    doesn't have to worry about which device we're currently writing to or
+    where in the device we are. It simply requests that the next page in the
+    pageset or header be written, leaving the details to this lower layer.
+    The lower layer remembers where in the sequence of devices and blocks each
+    pageset starts. The header always starts at the beginning of the allocated
+    storage.
+
+    So extents are:
+
+    struct extent {
+      unsigned long minimum, maximum;
+      struct extent *next;
+    }
+
+    These are combined into chains of extents for a device:
+
+    struct extent_chain {
+      int size; /* size of the extent ie sum (max-min+1) */
+      int allocs, frees;
+      char *name;
+      struct extent *first, *last_touched;
+    };
+
+    For each bdev, we need to store a little more info:
+
+    struct suspend_bdev_info {
+       struct block_device *bdev;
+       dev_t dev_t;
+       int bmap_shift;
+       int blocks_per_page;
+    };
+
+    The dev_t is used to identify the device in the stored image. As a result,
+    we expect devices at resume time to have the same major and minor numbers
+    as they had while suspending.  This is primarily a concern where the user
+    utilises LVM for storage, as they will need to dmsetup their partitions in
+    such a way as to maintain this consistency at resume time.
+
+    bmap_shift and blocks_per_page apply the effects of variations in blocks
+    per page settings for the filesystem and underlying bdev. For most
+    filesystems, these are the same, but for xfs, they can have independant
+    values.
+
+    Combining these two structures together, we have everything we need to
+    record what devices and what blocks on each device are being used to
+    store the image, and to submit i/o using bio_submit.
+
+    The last elements in the picture are a means of recording how the storage
+    is being used.
+
+    We do this first and foremost by implementing a layer of abstraction on
+    top of the devices and extent chains which allows us to view however many
+    devices there might be as one long storage tape, with a single 'head' that
+    tracks a 'current position' on the tape:
+
+    struct extent_iterate_state {
+      struct extent_chain *chains;
+      int num_chains;
+      int current_chain;
+      struct extent *current_extent;
+      unsigned long current_offset;
+    };
+
+    That is, *chains points to an array of size num_chains of extent chains.
+    For the filewriter, this is always a single chain. For the swapwriter, the
+    array is of size MAX_SWAPFILES.
+
+    current_chain, current_extent and current_offset thus point to the current
+    index in the chains array (and into a matching array of struct
+    suspend_bdev_info), the current extent in that chain (to optimise access),
+    and the current value in the offset.
+
+    The image is divided into three parts:
+    - The header
+    - Pageset 1
+    - Pageset 2
+
+    The header always starts at the first device and first block. We know its
+    size before we begin to save the image because we carefully account for
+    everything that will be stored in it.
+
+    The second pageset (LRU) is stored first. It begins on the next page after
+    the end of the header.
+
+    The first pageset is stored second. It's start location is only known once
+    pageset2 has been saved, since pageset2 may be compressed as it is written.
+    This location is thus recorded at the end of saving pageset2. It is page
+    aligned also.
+
+    Since this information is needed at resume time, and the location of extents
+    in memory will differ at resume time, this needs to be stored in a portable
+    way:
+
+    struct extent_iterate_saved_state {
+        int chain_num;
+        int extent_num;
+        unsigned long offset;
+    };
+
+    We can thus implement a layer of abstraction wherein the core of TuxOnIce
+    doesn't have to worry about which device we're currently writing to or
+    where in the device we are. It simply requests that the next page in the
+    pageset or header be written, leaving the details to this layer, and
+    invokes the routines to remember and restore the position, without having
+    to worry about the details of how the data is arranged on disk or such like.
+
+    c) Modules
+
+    One aim in designing TuxOnIce was to make it flexible. We wanted to allow
+    for the implementation of different methods of transforming a page to be
+    written to disk and different methods of getting the pages stored.
+
+    In early versions (the betas and perhaps Suspend1), compression support was
+    inlined in the image writing code, and the data structures and code for
+    managing swap were intertwined with the rest of the code. A number of people
+    had expressed interest in implementing image encryption, and alternative
+    methods of storing the image.
+
+    In order to achieve this, TuxOnIce was given a modular design.
+
+    A module is a single file which encapsulates the functionality needed
+    to transform a pageset of data (encryption or compression, for example),
+    or to write the pageset to a device. The former type of module is called
+    a 'page-transformer', the later a 'writer'.
+
+    Modules are linked together in pipeline fashion. There may be zero or more
+    page transformers in a pipeline, and there is always exactly one writer.
+    The pipeline follows this pattern:
+
+		---------------------------------
+		|          TuxOnIce Core        |
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|	Page transformer 1	|
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|	Page transformer 2	|
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|            Writer		|
+		---------------------------------
+
+    During the writing of an image, the core code feeds pages one at a time
+    to the first module. This module performs whatever transformations it
+    implements on the incoming data, completely consuming the incoming data and
+    feeding output in a similar manner to the next module.
+
+    All routines are SMP safe, and the final result of the transformations is
+    written with an index (provided by the core) and size of the output by the
+    writer. As a result, we can have multithreaded I/O without needing to
+    worry about the sequence in which pages are written (or read).
+
+    During reading, the pipeline works in the reverse direction. The core code
+    calls the first module with the address of a buffer which should be filled.
+    (Note that the buffer size is always PAGE_SIZE at this time). This module
+    will in turn request data from the next module and so on down until the
+    writer is made to read from the stored image.
+
+    Part of definition of the structure of a module thus looks like this:
+
+        int (*rw_init) (int rw, int stream_number);
+        int (*rw_cleanup) (int rw);
+        int (*write_chunk) (struct page *buffer_page);
+        int (*read_chunk) (struct page *buffer_page, int sync);
+
+    It should be noted that the _cleanup routine may be called before the
+    full stream of data has been read or written. While writing the image,
+    the user may (depending upon settings) choose to abort suspending, and
+    if we are in the midst of writing the last portion of the image, a portion
+    of the second pageset may be reread. This may also happen if an error
+    occurs and we seek to abort the process of writing the image.
+
+    The modular design is also useful in a number of other ways. It provides
+    a means where by we can add support for:
+
+    - providing overall initialisation and cleanup routines;
+    - serialising configuration information in the image header;
+    - providing debugging information to the user;
+    - determining memory and image storage requirements;
+    - dis/enabling components at run-time;
+    - configuring the module (see below);
+
+    ...and routines for writers specific to their work:
+    - Parsing a resume= location;
+    - Determining whether an image exists;
+    - Marking a resume as having been attempted;
+    - Invalidating an image;
+
+    Since some parts of the core - the user interface and storage manager
+    support - have use for some of these functions, they are registered as
+    'miscellaneous' modules as well.
+
+    d) Sysfs data structures.
+
+    This brings us naturally to support for configuring TuxOnIce. We desired to
+    provide a way to make TuxOnIce as flexible and configurable as possible.
+    The user shouldn't have to reboot just because they want to now hibernate to
+    a file instead of a partition, for example.
+
+    To accomplish this, TuxOnIce implements a very generic means whereby the
+    core and modules can register new sysfs entries. All TuxOnIce entries use
+    a single _store and _show routine, both of which are found in
+    tuxonice_sysfs.c in the kernel/power directory. These routines handle the
+    most common operations - getting and setting the values of bits, integers,
+    longs, unsigned longs and strings in one place, and allow overrides for
+    customised get and set options as well as side-effect routines for all
+    reads and writes.
+
+    When combined with some simple macros, a new sysfs entry can then be defined
+    in just a couple of lines:
+
+        SYSFS_INT("progress_granularity", SYSFS_RW, &progress_granularity, 1,
+                        2048, 0, NULL),
+
+    This defines a sysfs entry named "progress_granularity" which is rw and
+    allows the user to access an integer stored at &progress_granularity, giving
+    it a value between 1 and 2048 inclusive.
+
+    Sysfs entries are registered under /sys/power/tuxonice, and entries for
+    modules are located in a subdirectory named after the module.

+1. What is it?
+
+   Imagine you're sitting at your computer, working away. For some reason, you
+   need to turn off your computer for a while - perhaps it's time to go home
+   for the day. When you come back to your computer next, you're going to want
+   to carry on where you left off. Now imagine that you could push a button and
+   have your computer store the contents of its memory to disk and power down.
+   Then, when you next start up your computer, it loads that image back into
+   memory and you can carry on from where you were, just as if you'd never
+   turned the computer off. You have far less time to start up, no reopening of
+   applications or finding what directory you put that file in yesterday.
+   That's what TuxOnIce does.
+
+   TuxOnIce has a long heritage. It began life as work by Gabor Kuti, who,
+   with some help from Pavel Machek, got an early version going in 1999. The
+   project was then taken over by Florent Chabaud while still in alpha version
+   numbers. Nigel Cunningham came on the scene when Florent was unable to
+   continue, moving the project into betas, then 1.0, 2.0 and so on up to
+   the present series. During the 2.0 series, the name was contracted to
+   Suspend2 and the website suspend2.net created. Beginning around July 2007,
+   a transition to calling the software TuxOnIce was made, to seek to help
+   make it clear that TuxOnIce is more concerned with hibernation than suspend
+   to ram.
+
+   Pavel Machek's swsusp code, which was merged around 2.5.17 retains the
+   original name, and was essentially a fork of the beta code until Rafael
+   Wysocki came on the scene in 2005 and began to improve it further.
+
+2. Why would you want it?
+
+   Why wouldn't you want it?
+
+   Being able to save the state of your system and quickly restore it improves
+   your productivity - you get a useful system in far less time than through
+   the normal boot process. You also get to be completely 'green', using zero
+   power, or as close to that as possible (the computer may still provide
+   minimal power to some devices, so they can initiate a power on, but that
+   will be the same amount of power as would be used if you told the computer
+   to shutdown.
+
+3. What do you need to use it?
+
+   a. Kernel Support.
+
+   i) The TuxOnIce patch.
+
+   TuxOnIce is part of the Linux Kernel. This version is not part of Linus's
+   2.6 tree at the moment, so you will need to download the kernel source and
+   apply the latest patch. Having done that, enable the appropriate options in
+   make [menu|x]config (under Power Management Options - look for "Enhanced
+   Hibernation"), compile and install your kernel. TuxOnIce works with SMP,
+   Highmem, preemption, fuse filesystems, x86-32, PPC and x86_64.
+
+   TuxOnIce patches are available from http://tuxonice.net.
+
+   ii) Compression support.
+
+   Compression support is implemented via the cryptoapi. You will therefore want
+   to select any Cryptoapi transforms that you want to use on your image from
+   the Cryptoapi menu while configuring your kernel. We recommend the use of the
+   LZO compression method - it is very fast and still achieves good compression.
+
+   You can also tell TuxOnIce to write its image to an encrypted and/or
+   compressed filesystem/swap partition. In that case, you don't need to do
+   anything special for TuxOnIce when it comes to kernel configuration.
+
+   iii) Configuring other options.
+
+   While you're configuring your kernel, try to configure as much as possible
+   to build as modules. We recommend this because there are a number of drivers
+   that are still in the process of implementing proper power management
+   support. In those cases, the best way to work around their current lack is
+   to build them as modules and remove the modules while hibernating. You might
+   also bug the driver authors to get their support up to speed, or even help!
+
+   b. Storage.
+
+   i) Swap.
+
+   TuxOnIce can store the hibernation image in your swap partition, a swap file or
+   a combination thereof. Whichever combination you choose, you will probably
+   want to create enough swap space to store the largest image you could have,
+   plus the space you'd normally use for swap. A good rule of thumb would be
+   to calculate the amount of swap you'd want without using TuxOnIce, and then
+   add the amount of memory you have. This swapspace can be arranged in any way
+   you'd like. It can be in one partition or file, or spread over a number. The
+   only requirement is that they be active when you start a hibernation cycle.
+
+   There is one exception to this requirement. TuxOnIce has the ability to turn
+   on one swap file or partition at the start of hibernating and turn it back off
+   at the end. If you want to ensure you have enough memory to store a image
+   when your memory is fully used, you might want to make one swap partition or
+   file for 'normal' use, and another for TuxOnIce to activate & deactivate
+   automatically. (Further details below).
+
+   ii) Normal files.
+
+   TuxOnIce includes a 'file allocator'. The file allocator can store your
+   image in a simple file. Since Linux has the concept of everything being a
+   file, this is more powerful than it initially sounds. If, for example, you
+   were to set up a network block device file, you could hibernate to a network
+   server. This has been tested and works to a point, but nbd itself isn't
+   stateless enough for our purposes.
+
+   Take extra care when setting up the file allocator. If you just type
+   commands without thinking and then try to hibernate, you could cause
+   irreversible corruption on your filesystems! Make sure you have backups.
+
+   Most people will only want to hibernate to a local file. To achieve that, do
+   something along the lines of:
+
+   echo "TuxOnIce" > /hibernation-file
+   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=512 >> /hibernation-file
+
+   This will create a 512MB file called /hibernation-file. To get TuxOnIce to use
+   it:
+
+   echo /hibernation-file > /sys/power/tuxonice/file/target
+
+   Then
+
+   cat /sys/power/tuxonice/resume
+
+   Put the results of this into your bootloader's configuration (see also step
+   C, below):
+
+   ---EXAMPLE-ONLY-DON'T-COPY-AND-PASTE---
+   # cat /sys/power/tuxonice/resume
+   file:/dev/hda2:0x1e001
+
+   In this example, we would edit the append= line of our lilo.conf|menu.lst
+   so that it included:
+
+   resume=file:/dev/hda2:0x1e001
+   ---EXAMPLE-ONLY-DON'T-COPY-AND-PASTE---
+
+   For those who are thinking 'Could I make the file sparse?', the answer is
+   'No!'. At the moment, there is no way for TuxOnIce to fill in the holes in
+   a sparse file while hibernating. In the longer term (post merge!), I'd like
+   to change things so that the file could be dynamically resized and have
+   holes filled as needed. Right now, however, that's not possible and not a
+   priority.
+
+   c. Bootloader configuration.
+
+   Using TuxOnIce also requires that you add an extra parameter to
+   your lilo.conf or equivalent. Here's an example for a swap partition:
+
+   append="resume=swap:/dev/hda1"
+
+   This would tell TuxOnIce that /dev/hda1 is a swap partition you
+   have. TuxOnIce will use the swap signature of this partition as a
+   pointer to your data when you hibernate. This means that (in this example)
+   /dev/hda1 doesn't need to be _the_ swap partition where all of your data
+   is actually stored. It just needs to be a swap partition that has a
+   valid signature.
+
+   You don't need to have a swap partition for this purpose. TuxOnIce
+   can also use a swap file, but usage is a little more complex. Having made
+   your swap file, turn it on and do
+
+   cat /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/headerlocations
+
+   (this assumes you've already compiled your kernel with TuxOnIce
+   support and booted it). The results of the cat command will tell you
+   what you need to put in lilo.conf:
+
+   For swap partitions like /dev/hda1, simply use resume=/dev/hda1.
+   For swapfile `swapfile`, use resume=swap:/dev/hda2:0x242d.
+
+   If the swapfile changes for any reason (it is moved to a different
+   location, it is deleted and recreated, or the filesystem is
+   defragmented) then you will have to check
+   /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/headerlocations for a new resume_block value.
+
+   Once you've compiled and installed the kernel and adjusted your bootloader
+   configuration, you should only need to reboot for the most basic part
+   of TuxOnIce to be ready.
+
+   If you only compile in the swap allocator, or only compile in the file
+   allocator, you don't need to add the "swap:" part of the resume=
+   parameters above. resume=/dev/hda2:0x242d will work just as well. If you
+   have compiled both and your storage is on swap, you can also use this
+   format (the swap allocator is the default allocator).
+
+   When compiling your kernel, one of the options in the 'Power Management
+   Support' menu, just above the 'Enhanced Hibernation (TuxOnIce)' entry is
+   called 'Default resume partition'. This can be used to set a default value
+   for the resume= parameter.
+
+   d. The hibernate script.
+
+   Since the driver model in 2.6 kernels is still being developed, you may need
+   to do more than just configure TuxOnIce. Users of TuxOnIce usually start the
+   process via a script which prepares for the hibernation cycle, tells the
+   kernel to do its stuff and then restore things afterwards. This script might
+   involve:
+
+   - Switching to a text console and back if X doesn't like the video card
+     status on resume.
+   - Un/reloading drivers that don't play well with hibernation.
+
+   Note that you might not be able to unload some drivers if there are
+   processes using them. You might have to kill off processes that hold
+   devices open. Hint: if your X server accesses an USB mouse, doing a
+   'chvt' to a text console releases the device and you can unload the
+   module.
+
+   Check out the latest script (available on tuxonice.net).
+
+   e. The userspace user interface.
+
+   TuxOnIce has very limited support for displaying status if you only apply
+   the kernel patch - it can printk messages, but that is all. In addition,
+   some of the functions mentioned in this document (such as cancelling a cycle
+   or performing interactive debugging) are unavailable. To utilise these
+   functions, or simply get a nice display, you need the 'userui' component.
+   Userui comes in three flavours, usplash, fbsplash and text. Text should
+   work on any console. Usplash and fbsplash require the appropriate
+   (distro specific?) support.
+
+   To utilise a userui, TuxOnIce just needs to be told where to find the
+   userspace binary:
+
+   echo "/usr/local/sbin/tuxoniceui_fbsplash" > /sys/power/tuxonice/user_interface/program
+
+   The hibernate script can do this for you, and a default value for this
+   setting can be configured when compiling the kernel. This path is also
+   stored in the image header, so if you have an initrd or initramfs, you can
+   use the userui during the first part of resuming (prior to the atomic
+   restore) by putting the binary in the same path in your initrd/ramfs.
+   Alternatively, you can put it in a different location and do an echo
+   similar to the above prior to the echo > do_resume. The value saved in the
+   image header will then be ignored.
+
+4. Why not just use the version already in the kernel?
+
+   The version in the vanilla kernel has a number of drawbacks. The most
+   serious of these are:
+	- it has a maximum image size of 1/2 total memory;
+	- it doesn't allocate storage until after it has snapshotted memory.
+	  This means that you can't be sure hibernating will work until you
+	  see it start to write the image;
+	- it does not allow you to press escape to cancel a cycle;
+	- it does not allow you to press escape to cancel resuming;
+	- it does not allow you to automatically swapon a file when
+	  starting a cycle;
+	- it does not allow you to use multiple swap partitions or files;
+	- it does not allow you to use ordinary files;
+	- it just invalidates an image and continues to boot if you
+	  accidentally boot the wrong kernel after hibernating;
+	- it doesn't support any sort of nice display while hibernating;
+	- it is moving toward requiring that you have an initrd/initramfs
+	  to ever have a hope of resuming (uswsusp). While uswsusp will
+	  address some of the concerns above, it won't address all of them,
+          and will be more complicated to get set up;
+        - it doesn't have support for suspend-to-both (write a hibernation
+	  image, then suspend to ram; I think this is known as ReadySafe
+	  under M$).
+
+5. How do you use it?
+
+   A hibernation cycle can be started directly by doing:
+
+	echo > /sys/power/tuxonice/do_hibernate
+
+   In practice, though, you'll probably want to use the hibernate script
+   to unload modules, configure the kernel the way you like it and so on.
+   In that case, you'd do (as root):
+
+	hibernate
+
+   See the hibernate script's man page for more details on the options it
+   takes.
+
+   If you're using the text or splash user interface modules, one feature of
+   TuxOnIce that you might find useful is that you can press Escape at any time
+   during hibernating, and the process will be aborted.
+
+   Due to the way hibernation works, this means you'll have your system back and
+   perfectly usable almost instantly. The only exception is when it's at the
+   very end of writing the image. Then it will need to reload a small (usually
+   4-50MBs, depending upon the image characteristics) portion first.
+
+   Likewise, when resuming, you can press escape and resuming will be aborted.
+   The computer will then powerdown again according to settings at that time for
+   the powerdown method or rebooting.
+
+   You can change the settings for powering down while the image is being
+   written by pressing 'R' to toggle rebooting and 'O' to toggle between
+   suspending to ram and powering down completely).
+
+   If you run into problems with resuming, adding the "noresume" option to
+   the kernel command line will let you skip the resume step and recover your
+   system. This option shouldn't normally be needed, because TuxOnIce modifies
+   the image header prior to the atomic restore, and will thus prompt you
+   if it detects that you've tried to resume an image before (this flag is
+   removed if you press Escape to cancel a resume, so you won't be prompted
+   then).
+
+   Recent kernels (2.6.24 onwards) add support for resuming from a different
+   kernel to the one that was hibernated (thanks to Rafael for his work on
+   this - I've just embraced and enhanced the support for TuxOnIce). This
+   should further reduce the need for you to use the noresume option.
+
+6. What do all those entries in /sys/power/tuxonice do?
+
+   /sys/power/tuxonice is the directory which contains files you can use to
+   tune and configure TuxOnIce to your liking. The exact contents of
+   the directory will depend upon the version of TuxOnIce you're
+   running and the options you selected at compile time. In the following
+   descriptions, names in brackets refer to compile time options.
+   (Note that they're all dependant upon you having selected CONFIG_TUXONICE
+   in the first place!).
+
+   Since the values of these settings can open potential security risks, the
+   writeable ones are accessible only to the root user. You may want to
+   configure sudo to allow you to invoke your hibernate script as an ordinary
+   user.
+
+   - alloc/failure_test
+
+   This debugging option provides a way of testing TuxOnIce's handling of
+   memory allocation failures. Each allocation type that TuxOnIce makes has
+   been given a unique number (see the source code). Echo the appropriate
+   number into this entry, and when TuxOnIce attempts to do that allocation,
+   it will pretend there was a failure and act accordingly.
+
+   - alloc/find_max_mem_allocated
+
+   This debugging option will cause TuxOnIce to find the maximum amount of
+   memory it used during a cycle, and report that information in debugging
+   information at the end of the cycle.
+
+   - alt_resume_param
+
+   Instead of powering down after writing a hibernation image, TuxOnIce
+   supports resuming from a different image. This entry lets you set the
+   location of the signature for that image (the resume= value you'd use
+   for it). Using an alternate image and keep_image mode, you can do things
+   like using an alternate image to power down an uninterruptible power
+   supply.
+
+   - block_io/target_outstanding_io
+
+   This value controls the amount of memory that the block I/O code says it
+   needs when the core code is calculating how much memory is needed for
+   hibernating and for resuming. It doesn't directly control the amount of
+   I/O that is submitted at any one time - that depends on the amount of
+   available memory (we may have more available than we asked for), the
+   throughput that is being achieved and the ability of the CPU to keep up
+   with disk throughput (particularly where we're compressing pages).
+
+   - checksum/enabled
+
+   Use cryptoapi hashing routines to verify that Pageset2 pages don't change
+   while we're saving the first part of the image, and to get any pages that
+   do change resaved in the atomic copy. This should normally not be needed,
+   but if you're seeing issues, please enable this. If your issues stop you
+   being able to resume, enable this option, hibernate and cancel the cycle
+   after the atomic copy is done. If the debugging info shows a non-zero
+   number of pages resaved, please report this to Nigel.
+
+   - compression/algorithm
+
+   Set the cryptoapi algorithm used for compressing the image.
+
+   - compression/expected_compression
+
+   These values allow you to set an expected compression ratio, which TuxOnice
+   will use in calculating whether it meets constraints on the image size. If
+   this expected compression ratio is not attained, the hibernation cycle will
+   abort, so it is wise to allow some spare. You can see what compression
+   ratio is achieved in the logs after hibernating.
+
+   - debug_info:
+
+   This file returns information about your configuration that may be helpful
+   in diagnosing problems with hibernating.
+
+   - did_suspend_to_both:
+
+   This file can be used when you hibernate with powerdown method 3 (ie suspend
+   to ram after writing the image). There can be two outcomes in this case. We
+   can resume from the suspend-to-ram before the battery runs out, or we can run
+   out of juice and and up resuming like normal. This entry lets you find out,
+   post resume, which way we went. If the value is 1, we resumed from suspend
+   to ram. This can be useful when actions need to be run post suspend-to-ram
+   that don't need to be run if we did the normal resume from power off.
+
+   - do_hibernate:
+
+   When anything is written to this file, the kernel side of TuxOnIce will
+   begin to attempt to write an image to disk and power down. You'll normally
+   want to run the hibernate script instead, to get modules unloaded first.
+
+   - do_resume:
+
+   When anything is written to this file TuxOnIce will attempt to read and
+   restore an image. If there is no image, it will return almost immediately.
+   If an image exists, the echo > will never return. Instead, the original
+   kernel context will be restored and the original echo > do_hibernate will
+   return.
+
+   - */enabled
+
+   These option can be used to temporarily disable various parts of TuxOnIce.
+
+   - extra_pages_allowance
+
+   When TuxOnIce does its atomic copy, it calls the driver model suspend
+   and resume methods. If you have DRI enabled with a driver such as fglrx,
+   this can result in the driver allocating a substantial amount of memory
+   for storing its state. Extra_pages_allowance tells TuxOnIce how much
+   extra memory it should ensure is available for those allocations. If
+   your attempts at hibernating end with a message in dmesg indicating that
+   insufficient extra pages were allowed, you need to increase this value.
+
+   - file/target:
+
+   Read this value to get the current setting. Write to it to point TuxOnice
+   at a new storage location for the file allocator. See section 3.b.ii above
+   for details of how to set up the file allocator.
+
+   - freezer_test
+
+   This entry can be used to get TuxOnIce to just test the freezer and prepare
+   an image without actually doing a hibernation cycle. It is useful for
+   diagnosing freezing and image preparation issues.
+
+   - full_pageset2
+
+   TuxOnIce divides the pages that are stored in an image into two sets. The
+   difference between the two sets is that pages in pageset 1 are atomically
+   copied, and pages in pageset 2 are written to disk without being copied
+   first. A page CAN be written to disk without being copied first if and only
+   if its contents will not be modified or used at any time after userspace
+   processes are frozen. A page MUST be in pageset 1 if its contents are
+   modified or used at any time after userspace processes have been frozen.
+
+   Normally (ie if this option is enabled), TuxOnIce will put all pages on the
+   per-zone LRUs in pageset2, then remove those pages used by any userspace
+   user interface helper and TuxOnIce storage manager that are running,
+   together with pages used by the GEM memory manager introduced around 2.6.28
+   kernels.
+
+   If this option is disabled, a much more conservative approach will be taken.
+   The only pages in pageset2 will be those belonging to userspace processes,
+   with the exclusion of those belonging to the TuxOnIce userspace helpers
+   mentioned above. This will result in a much smaller pageset2, and will
+   therefore result in smaller images than are possible with this option
+   enabled.
+
+   - ignore_rootfs
+
+   TuxOnIce records which device is mounted as the root filesystem when
+   writing the hibernation image. It will normally check at resume time that
+   this device isn't already mounted - that would be a cause of filesystem
+   corruption. In some particular cases (RAM based root filesystems), you
+   might want to disable this check. This option allows you to do that.
+
+   - image_exists:
+
+   Can be used in a script to determine whether a valid image exists at the
+   location currently pointed to by resume=. Returns up to three lines.
+   The first is whether an image exists (-1 for unsure, otherwise 0 or 1).
+   If an image eixsts, additional lines will return the machine and version.
+   Echoing anything to this entry removes any current image.
+
+   - image_size_limit:
+
+   The maximum size of hibernation image written to disk, measured in megabytes
+   (1024*1024).
+
+   - last_result:
+
+   The result of the last hibernation cycle, as defined in
+   include/linux/suspend-debug.h with the values SUSPEND_ABORTED to
+   SUSPEND_KEPT_IMAGE. This is a bitmask.
+
+   - late_cpu_hotplug:
+
+   This sysfs entry controls whether cpu hotplugging is done - as normal - just
+   before (unplug) and after (replug) the atomic copy/restore (so that all
+   CPUs/cores are available for multithreaded I/O). The alternative is to
+   unplug all secondary CPUs/cores at the start of hibernating/resuming, and
+   replug them at the end of resuming. No multithreaded I/O will be possible in
+   this configuration, but the odd machine has been reported to require it.
+
+   - lid_file:
+
+   This determines which ACPI button file we look in to determine whether the
+   lid is open or closed after resuming from suspend to disk or power off.
+   If the entry is set to "lid/LID", we'll open /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state
+   and check its contents at the appropriate moment. See post_wake_state below
+   for more details on how this entry is used.
+
+   - log_everything (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   Setting this option results in all messages printed being logged. Normally,
+   only a subset are logged, so as to not slow the process and not clutter the
+   logs. Useful for debugging. It can be toggled during a cycle by pressing
+   'L'.
+
+   - no_load_direct:
+
+   This is a debugging option. If, when loading the atomically copied pages of
+   an image, TuxOnIce finds that the destination address for a page is free,
+   it will normally allocate the image, load the data directly into that
+   address and skip it in the atomic restore. If this option is disabled, the
+   page will be loaded somewhere else and atomically restored like other pages.
+
+   - no_flusher_thread:
+
+   When doing multithreaded I/O (see below), the first online CPU can be used
+   to _just_ submit compressed pages when writing the image, rather than
+   compressing and submitting data. This option is normally disabled, but has
+   been included because Nigel would like to see whether it will be more useful
+   as the number of cores/cpus in computers increases.
+
+   - no_multithreaded_io:
+
+   TuxOnIce will normally create one thread per cpu/core on your computer,
+   each of which will then perform I/O. This will generally result in
+   throughput that's the maximum the storage medium can handle. There
+   shouldn't be any reason to disable multithreaded I/O now, but this option
+   has been retained for debugging purposes.
+
+   - no_pageset2
+
+   See the entry for full_pageset2 above for an explanation of pagesets.
+   Enabling this option causes TuxOnIce to do an atomic copy of all pages,
+   thereby limiting the maximum image size to 1/2 of memory, as swsusp does.
+
+   - no_pageset2_if_unneeded
+
+   See the entry for full_pageset2 above for an explanation of pagesets.
+   Enabling this option causes TuxOnIce to act like no_pageset2 was enabled
+   if and only it isn't needed anyway. This option may still make TuxOnIce
+   less reliable because pageset2 pages are normally used to store the
+   atomic copy - drivers that want to do allocations of larger amounts of
+   memory in one shot will be more likely to find that those amounts aren't
+   available if this option is enabled.
+
+   - pause_between_steps (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This option is used during debugging, to make TuxOnIce pause between
+   each step of the process. It is ignored when the nice display is on.
+
+   - post_wake_state:
+
+   TuxOnIce provides support for automatically waking after a user-selected
+   delay, and using a different powerdown method if the lid is still closed.
+   (Yes, we're assuming a laptop).  This entry lets you choose what state
+   should be entered next. The values are those described under
+   powerdown_method, below. It can be used to suspend to RAM after hibernating,
+   then powerdown properly (say) 20 minutes. It can also be used to power down
+   properly, then wake at (say) 6.30am and suspend to RAM until you're ready
+   to use the machine.
+
+   - powerdown_method:
+
+   Used to select a method by which TuxOnIce should powerdown after writing the
+   image. Currently:
+
+   0: Don't use ACPI to power off.
+   3: Attempt to enter Suspend-to-ram.
+   4: Attempt to enter ACPI S4 mode.
+   5: Attempt to power down via ACPI S5 mode.
+
+   Note that these options are highly dependant upon your hardware & software:
+
+   3: When succesful, your machine suspends to ram instead of powering off.
+      The advantage of using this mode is that it doesn't matter whether your
+      battery has enough charge to make it through to your next resume. If it
+      lasts, you will simply resume from suspend to ram (and the image on disk
+      will be discarded). If the battery runs out, you will resume from disk
+      instead. The disadvantage is that it takes longer than a normal
+      suspend-to-ram to enter the state, since the suspend-to-disk image needs
+      to be written first.
+   4/5: When successful, your machine will be off and comsume (almost) no power.
+      But it might still react to some external events like opening the lid or
+      trafic on  a network or usb device. For the bios, resume is then the same
+      as warm boot, similar to a situation where you used the command `reboot'
+      to reboot your machine. If your machine has problems on warm boot or if
+      you want to protect your machine with the bios password, this is probably
+      not the right choice. Mode 4 may be necessary on some machines where ACPI
+      wake up methods need to be run to properly reinitialise hardware after a
+      hibernation cycle.
+   0: Switch the machine completely off. The only possible wakeup is the power
+      button. For the bios, resume is then the same as a cold boot, in
+      particular you would  have to provide your bios boot password if your
+      machine uses that feature for booting.
+
+   - progressbar_granularity_limit:
+
+   This option can be used to limit the granularity of the progress bar
+   displayed with a bootsplash screen. The value is the maximum number of
+   steps. That is, 10 will make the progress bar jump in 10% increments.
+
+   - reboot:
+
+   This option causes TuxOnIce to reboot rather than powering down
+   at the end of saving an image. It can be toggled during a cycle by pressing
+   'R'.
+
+   - resume:
+
+   This sysfs entry can be used to read and set the location in which TuxOnIce
+   will look for the signature of an image - the value set using resume= at
+   boot time or CONFIG_PM_STD_PARTITION ("Default resume partition"). By
+   writing to this file as well as modifying your bootloader's configuration
+   file (eg menu.lst), you can set or reset the location of your image or the
+   method of storing the image without rebooting.
+
+   - replace_swsusp (CONFIG_TOI_REPLACE_SWSUSP):
+
+   This option makes
+
+     echo disk > /sys/power/state
+
+   activate TuxOnIce instead of swsusp. Regardless of whether this option is
+   enabled, any invocation of swsusp's resume time trigger will cause TuxOnIce
+   to check for an image too. This is due to the fact that at resume time, we
+   can't know whether this option was enabled until we see if an image is there
+   for us to resume from. (And when an image exists, we don't care whether we
+   did replace swsusp anyway - we just want to resume).
+
+   - resume_commandline:
+
+   This entry can be read after resuming to see the commandline that was used
+   when resuming began. You might use this to set up two bootloader entries
+   that are the same apart from the fact that one includes a extra append=
+   argument "at_work=1". You could then grep resume_commandline in your
+   post-resume scripts and configure networking (for example) differently
+   depending upon whether you're at home or work. resume_commandline can be
+   set to arbitrary text if you wish to remove sensitive contents.
+
+   - swap/swapfilename:
+
+   This entry is used to specify the swapfile or partition that
+   TuxOnIce will attempt to swapon/swapoff automatically. Thus, if
+   I normally use /dev/hda1 for swap, and want to use /dev/hda2 for specifically
+   for my hibernation image, I would
+
+   echo /dev/hda2 > /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/swapfile
+
+   /dev/hda2 would then be automatically swapon'd and swapoff'd. Note that the
+   swapon and swapoff occur while other processes are frozen (including kswapd)
+   so this swap file will not be used up when attempting to free memory. The
+   parition/file is also given the highest priority, so other swapfiles/partitions
+   will only be used to save the image when this one is filled.
+
+   The value of this file is used by headerlocations along with any currently
+   activated swapfiles/partitions.
+
+   - swap/headerlocations:
+
+   This option tells you the resume= options to use for swap devices you
+   currently have activated. It is particularly useful when you only want to
+   use a swap file to store your image. See above for further details.
+
+   - test_bio
+
+   This is a debugging option. When enabled, TuxOnIce will not hibernate.
+   Instead, when asked to write an image, it will skip the atomic copy,
+   just doing the writing of the image and then returning control to the
+   user at the point where it would have powered off. This is useful for
+   testing throughput in different configurations.
+
+   - test_filter_speed
+
+   This is a debugging option. When enabled, TuxOnIce will not hibernate.
+   Instead, when asked to write an image, it will not write anything or do
+   an atomic copy, but will only run any enabled compression algorithm on the
+   data that would have been written (the source pages of the atomic copy in
+   the case of pageset 1). This is useful for comparing the performance of
+   compression algorithms and for determining the extent to which an upgrade
+   to your storage method would improve hibernation speed.
+
+   - user_interface/debug_sections (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This value, together with the console log level, controls what debugging
+   information is displayed. The console log level determines the level of
+   detail, and this value determines what detail is displayed. This value is
+   a bit vector, and the meaning of the bits can be found in the kernel tree
+   in include/linux/tuxonice.h. It can be overridden using the kernel's
+   command line option suspend_dbg.
+
+   - user_interface/default_console_level (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This determines the value of the console log level at the start of a
+   hibernation cycle. If debugging is compiled in, the console log level can be
+   changed during a cycle by pressing the digit keys. Meanings are:
+
+   0: Nice display.
+   1: Nice display plus numerical progress.
+   2: Errors only.
+   3: Low level debugging info.
+   4: Medium level debugging info.
+   5: High level debugging info.
+   6: Verbose debugging info.
+
+   - user_interface/enable_escape:
+
+   Setting this to "1" will enable you abort a hibernation cycle or resuming by
+   pressing escape, "0" (default) disables this feature. Note that enabling
+   this option means that you cannot initiate a hibernation cycle and then walk
+   away from your computer, expecting it to be secure. With feature disabled,
+   you can validly have this expectation once TuxOnice begins to write the
+   image to disk. (Prior to this point, it is possible that TuxOnice might
+   about because of failure to freeze all processes or because constraints
+   on its ability to save the image are not met).
+
+   - user_interface/program
+
+   This entry is used to tell TuxOnice what userspace program to use for
+   providing a user interface while hibernating. The program uses a netlink
+   socket to pass messages back and forward to the kernel, allowing all of the
+   functions formerly implemented in the kernel user interface components.
+
+   - version:
+
+   The version of TuxOnIce you have compiled into the currently running kernel.
+
+   - wake_alarm_dir:
+
+   As mentioned above (post_wake_state), TuxOnIce supports automatically waking
+   after some delay. This entry allows you to select which wake alarm to use.
+   It should contain the value "rtc0" if you're wanting to use
+   /sys/class/rtc/rtc0.
+
+   - wake_delay:
+
+   This value determines the delay from the end of writing the image until the
+   wake alarm is triggered. You can set an absolute time by writing the desired
+   time into /sys/class/rtc/<wake_alarm_dir>/wakealarm and leaving these values
+   empty.
+
+   Note that for the wakeup to actually occur, you may need to modify entries
+   in /proc/acpi/wakeup. This is done by echoing the name of the button in the
+   first column (eg PBTN) into the file.
+
+7. How do you get support?
+
+   Glad you asked. TuxOnIce is being actively maintained and supported
+   by Nigel (the guy doing most of the kernel coding at the moment), Bernard
+   (who maintains the hibernate script and userspace user interface components)
+   and its users.
+
+   Resources availble include HowTos, FAQs and a Wiki, all available via
+   tuxonice.net.  You can find the mailing lists there.
+
+8. I think I've found a bug. What should I do?
+
+   By far and a way, the most common problems people have with TuxOnIce
+   related to drivers not having adequate power management support. In this
+   case, it is not a bug with TuxOnIce, but we can still help you. As we
+   mentioned above, such issues can usually be worked around by building the
+   functionality as modules and unloading them while hibernating. Please visit
+   the Wiki for up-to-date lists of known issues and work arounds.
+
+   If this information doesn't help, try running:
+
+   hibernate --bug-report
+
+   ..and sending the output to the users mailing list.
+
+   Good information on how to provide us with useful information from an
+   oops is found in the file REPORTING-BUGS, in the top level directory
+   of the kernel tree. If you get an oops, please especially note the
+   information about running what is printed on the screen through ksymoops.
+   The raw information is useless.
+
+9. When will XXX be supported?
+
+   If there's a feature missing from TuxOnIce that you'd like, feel free to
+   ask. We try to be obliging, within reason.
+
+   Patches are welcome. Please send to the list.
+
+10. How does it work?
+
+   TuxOnIce does its work in a number of steps.
+
+   a. Freezing system activity.
+
+   The first main stage in hibernating is to stop all other activity. This is
+   achieved in stages. Processes are considered in fours groups, which we will
+   describe in reverse order for clarity's sake: Threads with the PF_NOFREEZE
+   flag, kernel threads without this flag, userspace processes with the
+   PF_SYNCTHREAD flag and all other processes. The first set (PF_NOFREEZE) are
+   untouched by the refrigerator code. They are allowed to run during hibernating
+   and resuming, and are used to support user interaction, storage access or the
+   like. Other kernel threads (those unneeded while hibernating) are frozen last.
+   This leaves us with userspace processes that need to be frozen. When a
+   process enters one of the *_sync system calls, we set a PF_SYNCTHREAD flag on
+   that process for the duration of that call. Processes that have this flag are
+   frozen after processes without it, so that we can seek to ensure that dirty
+   data is synced to disk as quickly as possible in a situation where other
+   processes may be submitting writes at the same time. Freezing the processes
+   that are submitting data stops new I/O from being submitted. Syncthreads can
+   then cleanly finish their work. So the order is:
+
+   - Userspace processes without PF_SYNCTHREAD or PF_NOFREEZE;
+   - Userspace processes with PF_SYNCTHREAD (they won't have NOFREEZE);
+   - Kernel processes without PF_NOFREEZE.
+
+   b. Eating memory.
+
+   For a successful hibernation cycle, you need to have enough disk space to store the
+   image and enough memory for the various limitations of TuxOnIce's
+   algorithm. You can also specify a maximum image size. In order to attain
+   to those constraints, TuxOnIce may 'eat' memory. If, after freezing
+   processes, the constraints aren't met, TuxOnIce will thaw all the
+   other processes and begin to eat memory until its calculations indicate
+   the constraints are met. It will then freeze processes again and recheck
+   its calculations.
+
+   c. Allocation of storage.
+
+   Next, TuxOnIce allocates the storage that will be used to save
+   the image.
+
+   The core of TuxOnIce knows nothing about how or where pages are stored. We
+   therefore request the active allocator (remember you might have compiled in
+   more than one!) to allocate enough storage for our expect image size. If
+   this request cannot be fulfilled, we eat more memory and try again. If it
+   is fulfiled, we seek to allocate additional storage, just in case our
+   expected compression ratio (if any) isn't achieved. This time, however, we
+   just continue if we can't allocate enough storage.
+
+   If these calls to our allocator change the characteristics of the image
+   such that we haven't allocated enough memory, we also loop. (The allocator
+   may well need to allocate space for its storage information).
+
+   d. Write the first part of the image.
+
+   TuxOnIce stores the image in two sets of pages called 'pagesets'.
+   Pageset 2 contains pages on the active and inactive lists; essentially
+   the page cache. Pageset 1 contains all other pages, including the kernel.
+   We use two pagesets for one important reason: We need to make an atomic copy
+   of the kernel to ensure consistency of the image. Without a second pageset,
+   that would limit us to an image that was at most half the amount of memory
+   available. Using two pagesets allows us to store a full image. Since pageset
+   2 pages won't be needed in saving pageset 1, we first save pageset 2 pages.
+   We can then make our atomic copy of the remaining pages using both pageset 2
+   pages and any other pages that are free. While saving both pagesets, we are
+   careful not to corrupt the image. Among other things, we use lowlevel block
+   I/O routines that don't change the pagecache contents.
+
+   The next step, then, is writing pageset 2.
+
+   e. Suspending drivers and storing processor context.
+
+   Having written pageset2, TuxOnIce calls the power management functions to
+   notify drivers of the hibernation, and saves the processor state in preparation
+   for the atomic copy of memory we are about to make.
+
+   f. Atomic copy.
+
+   At this stage, everything else but the TuxOnIce code is halted. Processes
+   are frozen or idling, drivers are quiesced and have stored (ideally and where
+   necessary) their configuration in memory we are about to atomically copy.
+   In our lowlevel architecture specific code, we have saved the CPU state.
+   We can therefore now do our atomic copy before resuming drivers etc.
+
+   g. Save the atomic copy (pageset 1).
+
+   TuxOnice can then write the atomic copy of the remaining pages. Since we
+   have copied the pages into other locations, we can continue to use the
+   normal block I/O routines without fear of corruption our image.
+
+   f. Save the image header.
+
+   Nearly there! We save our settings and other parameters needed for
+   reloading pageset 1 in an 'image header'. We also tell our allocator to
+   serialise its data at this stage, so that it can reread the image at resume
+   time.
+
+   g. Set the image header.
+
+   Finally, we edit the header at our resume= location. The signature is
+   changed by the allocator to reflect the fact that an image exists, and to
+   point to the start of that data if necessary (swap allocator).
+
+   h. Power down.
+
+   Or reboot if we're debugging and the appropriate option is selected.
+
+   Whew!
+
+   Reloading the image.
+   --------------------
+
+   Reloading the image is essentially the reverse of all the above. We load
+   our copy of pageset 1, being careful to choose locations that aren't going
+   to be overwritten as we copy it back (We start very early in the boot
+   process, so there are no other processes to quiesce here). We then copy
+   pageset 1 back to its original location in memory and restore the process
+   context. We are now running with the original kernel. Next, we reload the
+   pageset 2 pages, free the memory and swap used by TuxOnIce, restore
+   the pageset header and restart processes. Sounds easy in comparison to
+   hibernating, doesn't it!
+
+   There is of course more to TuxOnIce than this, but this explanation
+   should be a good start. If there's interest, I'll write further
+   documentation on range pages and the low level I/O.
+
+11. Who wrote TuxOnIce?
+
+   (Answer based on the writings of Florent Chabaud, credits in files and
+   Nigel's limited knowledge; apologies to anyone missed out!)
+
+   The main developers of TuxOnIce have been...
+
+   Gabor Kuti
+   Pavel Machek
+   Florent Chabaud
+   Bernard Blackham
+   Nigel Cunningham
+
+   Significant portions of swsusp, the code in the vanilla kernel which
+   TuxOnIce enhances, have been worked on by Rafael Wysocki. Thanks should
+   also be expressed to him.
+
+   The above mentioned developers have been aided in their efforts by a host
+   of hundreds, if not thousands of testers and people who have submitted bug
+   fixes & suggestions. Of special note are the efforts of Michael Frank, who
+   had his computers repetitively hibernate and resume for literally tens of
+   thousands of cycles and developed scripts to stress the system and test
+   TuxOnIce far beyond the point most of us (Nigel included!) would consider
+   testing. His efforts have contributed as much to TuxOnIce as any of the
+   names above.

+		  need to do this before trying to resume, too.
+		  With overriding swsusp enabled, echoing disk  to /sys/power/state will

+

+		  continue booting that kernel, or reboot the machine. This option can be
+		  used to control how long to wait in such circumstances. -1 means wait
+		  forever. 0 means don't wait at all (do the default action, which will

+		  value of 2000 will be okay in most cases. If you are using
+		  DRI, the easiest way to find what value to use is to try to hibernate
+		  and look at how many pages were actually needed in the sysfs entry

+ * kernel/power/tuxonice_cluster.c
+ *
+ * Copyright (C) 2006-2010 Nigel Cunningham (nigel at tuxonice net)
+ *
+ * This file is released under the GPLv2.
+ *
+ * This file contains routines for cluster hibernation support.
+ *
+ * Based on ip autoconfiguration code in net/ipv4/ipconfig.c.
+ *
+ * How does it work?
+ *
+ * There is no 'master' node that tells everyone else what to do. All nodes
+ * send messages to the broadcast address/port, maintain a list of peers
+ * and figure out when to progress to the next step in hibernating or resuming.
+ * This makes us more fault tolerant when it comes to nodes coming and going
+ * (which may be more of an issue if we're hibernating when power supplies
+ * are being unreliable).
+ *
+ * At boot time, we start a ktuxonice thread that handles communication with
+ * other nodes. This node maintains a state machine that controls our progress
+ * through hibernating and resuming, keeping us in step with other nodes. Nodes
+ * are identified by their hw address.
+ *
+ * On startup, the node sends CLUSTER_PING on the configured interface's
+ * broadcast address, port $toi_cluster_port (see below) and begins to listen
+ * for other broadcast messages. CLUSTER_PING messages are repeated at
+ * intervals of 5 minutes, with a random offset to spread traffic out.
+ *
+ * A hibernation cycle is initiated from any node via
+ *
+ * echo > /sys/power/tuxonice/do_hibernate
+ *
+ * and (possibily) the hibernate script. At each step of the process, the node
+ * completes its work, and waits for all other nodes to signal completion of
+ * their work (or timeout) before progressing to the next step.
+ *
+ * Request/state  Action before reply	Possible reply	Next state
+ * HIBERNATE	  capable, pre-script	HIBERNATE|ACK	NODE_PREP
+ * 					HIBERNATE|NACK	INIT_0

+ *
+ * PREP		  prepare read image	PREP|ACK	IMAGE_READ
+ * 					PREP|NACK	(As NACK_IMAGE)
+ *
+ * IO		  read image		IO|ACK		POST_RESUME
+ *
+ * POST_RESUME	  thaw, post-script			RUNNING
+ *
+ * INIT_0	  init 0
+ *
+ * Other messages:
+ *
+ * - PING: Request for all other live nodes to send a PONG. Used at startup to
+ *   announce presence, when a node is suspected dead and periodically, in case
+ *   segments of the network are [un]plugged.
+ *
+ * - PONG: Response to a PING.
+ *
+ * - ABORT: Request to cancel writing an image.
+ *
+ * - BYE: Notification that this node is shutting down.
+ *
+ * Note 1: Repeated at 3s intervals until we continue to boot/resume, so that
+ * nodes which are slower to start up can get state synchronised. If a node
+ * starting up sees other nodes sending RESUME_PREP or IMAGE_READ, it may send
+ * ACK_IMAGE and they will wait for it to catch up. If it sees ACK_READ, it
+ * must invalidate its image (if any) and boot normally.
+ *
+ * Note 2: May occur when one node lost power or powered off while others
+ * hibernated. This node waits for others to complete resuming (ACK_READ)
+ * before completing its boot, so that it appears as a fail node restarting.
+ *
+ * If any node has an image, then it also has a list of nodes that hibernated
+ * in synchronisation with it. The node will wait for other nodes to appear
+ * or timeout before beginning its restoration.
+ *
+ * If a node has no image, it needs to wait, in case other nodes which do have
+ * an image are going to resume, but are taking longer to announce their
+ * presence. For this reason, the user can specify a timeout value and a number
+ * of nodes detected before we just continue. (We might want to assume in a
+ * cluster of, say, 15 nodes, if 8 others have booted without finding an image,
+ * the remaining nodes will too. This might help in situations where some nodes
+ * are much slower to boot, or more subject to hardware failures or such like).

+/** \mainpage TuxOnIce.
+ *
+ * TuxOnIce provides support for saving and restoring an image of
+ * system memory to an arbitrary storage device, either on the local computer,
+ * or across some network. The support is entirely OS based, so TuxOnIce
+ * works without requiring BIOS, APM or ACPI support. The vast majority of the
+ * code is also architecture independant, so it should be very easy to port
+ * the code to new architectures. TuxOnIce includes support for SMP, 4G HighMem
+ * and preemption. Initramfses and initrds are also supported.
+ *
+ * TuxOnIce uses a modular design, in which the method of storing the image is
+ * completely abstracted from the core code, as are transformations on the data
+ * such as compression and/or encryption (multiple 'modules' can be used to
+ * provide arbitrary combinations of functionality). The user interface is also
+ * modular, so that arbitrarily simple or complex interfaces can be used to
+ * provide anything from debugging information through to eye candy.

+ *
+ * Nigel would like to thank the following people for their work:
+ *
+ * Bernard Blackham <bernard@blackham.com.au><BR>
+ * Web page & Wiki administration, some coding. A person without whom
+ * TuxOnIce would not be where it is.
+ *
+ * Michael Frank <mhf@linuxmail.org><BR>
+ * Extensive testing and help with improving stability. I was constantly
+ * amazed by the quality and quantity of Michael's help.
+ *
+ * Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz><BR>
+ * Modifications, defectiveness pointing, being with Gabor at the very
+ * beginning, suspend to swap space, stop all tasks. Port to 2.4.18-ac and
+ * 2.5.17. Even though Pavel and I disagree on the direction suspend to
+ * disk should take, I appreciate the valuable work he did in helping Gabor
+ * get the concept working.
+ *
+ * ..and of course the myriads of TuxOnIce users who have helped diagnose
+ * and fix bugs, made suggestions on how to improve the code, proofread
+ * documentation, and donated time and money.
+ *
+ * Thanks also to corporate sponsors:
+ *
+ * <B>Redhat.</B>Sometime employer from May 2006 (my fault, not Redhat's!).
+ *
+ * <B>Cyclades.com.</B> Nigel's employers from Dec 2004 until May 2006, who
+ * allowed him to work on TuxOnIce and PM related issues on company time.
+ *
+ * <B>LinuxFund.org.</B> Sponsored Nigel's work on TuxOnIce for four months Oct
+ * 2003 to Jan 2004.
+ *
+ * <B>LAC Linux.</B> Donated P4 hardware that enabled development and ongoing
+ * maintenance of SMP and Highmem support.
+ *
+ * <B>OSDL.</B> Provided access to various hardware configurations, make
+ * occasional small donations to the project.
