Subject: [PATCH] fastboot: remove "wait for all devices before mounting root" delay

In the non-initrd case, we wait for all devices to finish their
probing before we try to mount the rootfs.
In practice, this means that we end up waiting 2 extra seconds for
the PS/2 mouse probing even though the root holding device has been
ready since a long time.

The previous two patches in this series made the RAID autodetect code
do it's own "wait for probing to be done" code, and added
"wait and retry" functionality in case the root device isn't actually
available.

These two changes should make it safe to remove the delay itself,
and this patch does this. On my test laptop, this reduces the boot time
by 2 seconds (kernel time goes from 3.9 to 1.9 seconds).
