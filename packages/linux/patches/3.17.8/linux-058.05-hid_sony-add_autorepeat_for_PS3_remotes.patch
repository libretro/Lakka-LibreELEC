Subject: [PATCH] [RFC] hid/sony: add autorepeat for PS3 remotes

Some applications using the PS3 remote would like to have autorepeat
from the device. Use the input subsystem's software emulation to provide
this capability, and enable those that don't need it to turn it off.
---
I'm not sure this is the correct approach, or if it is even appropriate
for a remote to do autorepeat. However, the media/rc subsystem does do
it by default, and it's been requested by users, so there is at least
some demand.

This compiled against the hid-sony driver with the PS3 remote changes
merged, but I have done no testing of it. If the approach seems
reasonable, I'll try to test it when the MythTV is idle.
