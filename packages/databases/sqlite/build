# sqlite fails to compile with fast-math link time optimization.

  CFLAGS=`echo $CFLAGS | sed -e "s|-ffast-math||g"`

# This option adds additional logic to the ANALYZE command and to the query planner
# that can help SQLite to chose a better query plan under certain situations. The
# ANALYZE command is enhanced to collect histogram data from each index and store
# that data in the sqlite_stat3 table. The query planner will then use the histogram
# data to help it make better index choices.
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3"

# When this C-preprocessor macro is defined, SQLite includes some additional APIs
# that provide convenient access to meta-data about tables and queries. The APIs that
# are enabled by this option are:
#  - sqlite3_column_database_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_database_name16()
#  - sqlite3_column_table_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_table_name16()
#  - sqlite3_column_origin_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_origin_name16()
#  - sqlite3_table_column_metadata()
