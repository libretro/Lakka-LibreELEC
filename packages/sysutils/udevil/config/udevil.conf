# IMPORTANT:  IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEMS IF THIS FILE
# IS MISCONFIGURED - EDIT WITH CARE
#
# Note:  For greater control for specific users, including root, copy this

# allowed_types determines what fstypes can be passed by a user to the u/mount
# program, what device filesystems may be un/mounted implicitly, and what
# network filesystems may be un/mounted.
# It may also include the 'file' keyword, indicating that the user is allowed
# to mount files (eg an ISO file).  The $KNOWN_FILESYSTEMS variable may
# be included to include common local filesystems as well as those listed in
# /etc/filesystems and /proc/filesystems.
# allowed_types_USERNAME, if present, is used to override allowed_types for
# the specific user 'USERNAME'.  For example, to allow user 'jim' to mount
# only vfat filesystems, add:
# allowed_types_jim = vfat
# Setting allowed_types = * does NOT allow all types, as this is a security
# risk, but does allow all recognized types.

# allowed_users is a list of users permitted to mount and unmount with udevil.
# Wildcards (* or ?) may be used in the usernames.  To allow all users,
# specify "allowed_users=*".  UIDs may be included using the form UID=1000.
# For example:  allowed_users = carl, UID=1000, pre*
# Also note that permission to execute udevil may be limited to users belonging
# to the group that owns /usr/bin/udevil, such as 'plugdev' or 'storage',
# depending on installation.
# allowed_users_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override allowed_users when
# mounting or unmounting a specific fstype (eg nfs, ext3, file).
# Note that when mounting a file, fstype will always be 'file' regardless of
# the internal fstype of the file.
# For example, to allow only user 'bob' to mount nfs shares, add:
# allowed_users_nfs = bob
# The root user is NOT automatically allowed to use udevil in some cases unless
# listed here (except for unmounting anything or mounting fstab devices).
allowed_users = *


# allowed_groups is a list of groups permitted to mount and unmount with
# udevil.  The user MUST belong to at least one of these groups.  Wildcards
# or GIDs may NOT be used in group names, but a single * may be used to allow
# all groups.
# Also note that permission to execute udevil may be limited to users belonging
# to the group that owns /usr/bin/udevil, such as 'plugdev' or 'storage',
# depending on installation.
# allowed_groups_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override allowed_groups when
# mounting or unmounting a specific fstype (eg nfs, ext3, file).  For example,
# to allow only members of the 'network' group to mount smb and nfs shares,
# use both of these lines:
# allowed_groups_smbfs = network
# allowed_groups_nfs = network
# The root user is NOT automatically allowed to use udevil in some cases unless
# listed here (except for unmounting anything or mounting fstab devices).

# allowed_media_dirs specifies the media directories in which user mount points
# may be located.  The first directory which exists and does not contain a
# wildcard will be used as the default media directory (normally /media or
# /run/media/$USER).
# The $USER variable, if included, will be replaced with the username of the
# user running udevil.  Wildcards may also be used in any directory EXCEPT the
# default.  Wildcards will not match a /
# allowed_media_dirs_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override allowed_media_dirs
# when mounting or unmounting a specific fstype (eg ext2, nfs).  For example,
# to cause /media/network to be used as the default media directory for
# nfs and ftpfs mounts, use these two lines:
# allowed_media_dirs_nfs   = /media/network, /media, /run/media/$USER
# allowed_media_dirs_ftpfs = /media/network, /media, /run/media/$USER
# NOTE: If you want only the user who mounted a device to have access to it
# and be allowed to unmount it, specify /run/media/$USER as the first
# allowed media directory.
# IMPORTANT:  If an allowed file is mounted to a media directory, the user may
# be permitted to unmount its associated loop device even though internal.
# INCLUDING /MNT HERE IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  ALL ALLOWED MEDIA DIRECTORIES
# SHOULD BE OWNED AND WRITABLE ONLY BY ROOT.
allowed_media_dirs = /media, /var/media, /run/media/$USER


# allowed_devices is the first criteria for what block devices users may mount
# or unmount.  If a device is not listed in allowed_devices, it cannot be
# un/mounted (unless in fstab).  However, even if a device is listed, other
# factors may prevent its use.  For example, access to system internal devices
# will be denied to normal users even if they are included in allowed_devices.  
# allowed_devices_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override allowed_devices when
# mounting or unmounting a specific fstype (eg ext3, ntfs).  For example, to
# prevent all block devices containing an ext4 filesystem from being
# un/mounted use:
# allowed_devices_ext4 =
# Note: Wildcards may be used, but a wildcard will never match a /, except
# for "allowed_devices=*" which allows any device.  The recommended setting is
# allowed_devices = /dev/*
# WARNING:  ALLOWING USERS TO MOUNT DEVICES OUTSIDE OF /dev CAN CAUSE SERIOUS
# SECURITY PROBLEMS.  DO NOT ALLOW DEVICES IN /dev/shm
allowed_devices = /dev/*


# allowed_internal_devices causes udevil to treat any listed block devices as
# removable, thus allowing normal users to un/mount them (providing they are
# also listed in allowed_devices).
# allowed_internal_devices_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override
# allowed_internal_devices when mounting or unmounting a specific fstype
# (eg ext3, ntfs).  For example, to allow block devices containing a vfat
# filesystem to be un/mounted even if they are system internal devices, use:
# allowed_internal_devices_vfat = /dev/sdb*
# Some removable esata drives look like internal drives to udevil.  To avoid
# this problem, they can be treated as removable with this setting.
# WARNING:  SETTING A SYSTEM DEVICE HERE CAN CAUSE SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEMS.
# allowed_internal_devices =


# allowed_internal_uuids and allowed_internal_uuids_FSTYPE work similarly to
# allowed_internal_devices, except that UUIDs are specified instead of devices.
# For example, to allow un/mounting of an internal filesystem based on UUID:
# allowed_internal_uuids = cc0c4489-8def-1e5b-a304-ab87c3cb626c0
# WARNING:  SETTING A SYSTEM DEVICE HERE CAN CAUSE SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEMS.

# forbidden_devices is used to prevent block devices from being un/mounted
# even if other settings would allow them (except devices in fstab).
# forbidden_devices_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override
# forbidden_devices when mounting or unmounting a specific fstype
# (eg ext3, ntfs).  For example, to prevent device /dev/sdd1 from being
# mounted when it contains an ntfs filesystem, use:
# forbidden_devices_ntfs = /dev/sdd1
# NOTE: device node paths are canonicalized before being tested, so forbidding
# a link to a device will have no effect.

# allowed_networks determines what hosts may be un/mounted by udevil users when
# using nfs, cifs, smbfs, curlftpfs, ftpfs, or sshfs.  Hosts may be specified
# using a hostname (eg myserver.com) or IP address (192.168.1.100).
# Wildcards may be used in hostnames and IP addresses, but CIDR notation 
# (192.168.1.0/16) is NOT supported.  IP v6 is supported.  For example:
# allowed_networks = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.*, 10.0.0.*, localmachine, *.okay.com
# Or, to prevent un/mounting of any network shares, set:
# allowed_networks =
# allowed_networks_FSTYPE, if present, is used to override allowed_networks
# when mounting or unmounting a specific network fstype (eg nfs, cifs, sshfs,
# curlftpfs).  For example, to limit nfs and samba shares to only local
# networks, use these two lines:
# allowed_networks_nfs = 192.168.1.*, 10.0.0.*
# allowed_networks_cifs = 192.168.1.*, 10.0.0.*
allowed_networks = *


# forbidden_networks and forbidden_networks_FSTYPE are used to specify networks
# that are never allowed, even if other settings allow them (except fstab).
# NO REVERSE LOOKUP IS PERFORMED, so including bad.com will only have an effect
# if the user uses that hostname.  IP lookup is always performed, so forbidding
# an IP address will also forbid all corresponding hostnames.
forbidden_networks = 


# allowed_files is used to determine what files in what directories may be
# un/mounted.  A user must also have read permission on a file to mount it.
# Note: Wildcards may be used, but a wildcard will never match a /, except
# for "allowed_files=*" which allows any file.  For example, to allow only
# files in the /share directory to be mounted, use:
# allowed_files = /share/*
# NOTE:  Specifying allowed_files_FSTYPE will NOT work because the fstype of
# files is always 'file'.
allowed_files = *


# forbidden_files is used to specify files that are never allowed, even if
# other settings allow them (except fstab).  Specify a full path.

# NOTE: file paths are canonicalized before being tested, so forbidding
# a link to a file will have no effect.
