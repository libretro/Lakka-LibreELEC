* change fxsave to be global variable (static) instand of stack variable,
to really make it 16 bytes aligned.

this bug happens because we compile our code with -Os
which effects the stack preferred stack boundary (-mpreferred-stack-boundary)
to be 2^2 = 4 bytes instand of 2^4 = 16 bytes

and then __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) does always work for stack variables.

this adds (atleast) 512 bytes to programs which uses -ffast-math
but allows them to use DAZ optimization.
