Subject: [PATCH] panfrost: Process scissor state earlier

Otherwise, if batch->scissor_culls_everything is set for a single draw,
every draw after it in the batch will be skipped because the new
scissor/viewport state will never be processed. Process scissor state
early in draw_vbo to fix this interaction.

We do need to be careful: setting something on the batch can only happen when
we've decided on a batch. If we have to select a fresh batch due to too many
draws, that must happen first. This is pretty clear in the code but worth noting
for the diff.
