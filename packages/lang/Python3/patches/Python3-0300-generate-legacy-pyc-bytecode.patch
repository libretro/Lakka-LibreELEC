Subject: [PATCH] Always generate legacy bytecode (allows removal of py source
 code)

We want to create compiled bytecode for modules in the read-only
squashfs, and we also want to avoid distributing the py source code
which is a waste of space.

Unfortunately, after PEP3147, it's no longer possible to distribute
pyc bytecode without the corresponding py source code unless the
bytecode is generated using the "legacy" layout (ie. not using __pycache__).

Since all packages process their Python source code in different ways,
but ultimately all compile it via a call to py_compile.compile(), the
easiest solution is to patch py_compile.compile() so that it only
generates legacy bytecode.
