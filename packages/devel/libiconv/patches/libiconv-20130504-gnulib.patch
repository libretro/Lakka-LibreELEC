+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
+# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
+# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

+/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
+   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
+   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
+   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
+   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.
+
+   This macro is useful for marking a function as a potential
+   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
+   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
+   instead.  However, one of the reasons that a function is a
+   portability trap is if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring
+   FUNCTION with a different signature in C is a compilation error, so
+   this macro must use the same type as any existing declaration so
+   that programs that avoid the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to
+   compile merely because they included a header that poisoned the
+   function.  But this implies that _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to
+   use if FUNCTION is known to already have a declaration.  Use of
+   this macro implies that there must not be any other macro hiding
+   the declaration of FUNCTION; but undefining FUNCTION first is part
+   of the poisoning process anyway (although for symbols that are
+   provided only via a macro, the result is a compilation error rather
+   than a warning containing "literal string").  Also note that in
+   C++, it is only safe to use if FUNCTION has no overloads.
+
+   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
+   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
+     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
+     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
+   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
+     #undef getline
+     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
+     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
+       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
+     #endif
+
+   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
+   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
+   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
+   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
+   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
+   #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
+   static char ***rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
+   _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
+   # undef environ
+   # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
+   #endif

+\`configure' configures this package to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+

+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+@node Enabling Relocatability
+@section Enabling Relocatability
+
+It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time that
+packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a program,
+installed by another user on the same machine, to his home directory,
+and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users need to go
+through @code{configure; make; make install} with all its
+dependencies, options, and hurdles.
+
+Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the ``ease of
+installation'' problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to
+@file{/usr} or @file{/usr/local}.  This means that users need root
+privileges to install a binary package, and prevents installing two
+different versions of the same binary package.
+
+A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
+on the file system.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
+and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink. It is
+possible to do the same thing with a hard link @emph{only} if the hard
+link file is in the same directory as the real program.
+
+To configure a program to be relocatable, add
+@option{--enable-relocatable} to the @command{configure} command line.
+
+On some OSes the executables remember the location of shared libraries
+and prefer them over any other search path.  Therefore, such an
+executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
+installation directory and only then in the current installation
+directory.  Thus, for reliability, it is best to also give a
+@option{--prefix} option pointing to a directory that does not exist
+now and which never will be created, e.g.@:
+@option{--prefix=/nonexistent}.  You may use
+@code{DESTDIR=@var{dest-dir}} on the @command{make} command line to
+avoid installing into that directory.
+
+We do not recommend using a prefix writable by unprivileged users
+(e.g.@: @file{/tmp/inst$$}) because such a directory can be recreated
+by an unprivileged user after the original directory has been removed.
+We also do not recommend prefixes that might be behind an automounter
+(e.g.@: @file{$HOME/inst$$}) because of the performance impact of
+directory searching.
+
+Here's a sample installation run that takes into account all these
+recommendations:
+
+@example
+./configure --enable-relocatable --prefix=/nonexistent
+make
+make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inst$$
+@end example
+
+Installation with @option{--enable-relocatable} will not work for
+setuid or setgid executables, because such executables search only
+system library paths for security reasons.  Also, installation with
+@option{--enable-relocatable} might not work on OpenBSD, when the
+package contains shared libraries and libtool versions 1.5.xx are used.
+
+The runtime penalty and size penalty are negligible on GNU/Linux (just
+one system call more when an executable is launched), and small on
+other systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable
+and executes the real program).

+\`configure' configures this package to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]

+  --libdir=DIR            object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
+  --includedir=DIR        C header files [PREFIX/include]
+  --oldincludedir=DIR     C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]

+  --with-sysroot=DIR Search for dependent libraries within DIR
+                        (or the compiler's sysroot if not specified).
+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+<h2>DESCRIPTION

+</h2>
+
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
+<b>iconv</b> program converts text from one encoding to
+another encoding. More precisely, it converts <b>from</b>
+the encoding given for the <b>&minus;f</b> option <b>to</b>
+the encoding given for the <b>&minus;t</b> option. Either of
+these encodings defaults to the encoding of the current
+locale. All the <i>inputfile</i>s are read and converted in
+turn; if no <i>inputfile</i> is given, the standard input is
+used. The converted text is printed to standard output.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The encodings
+permitted are system dependent. For the libiconv
+implementation, they are listed in the iconv_open(3) manual
+page.</p>

+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>iconv
+&minus;l</b> or <b>iconv &minus;&minus;list</b> command
+lists the names of the supported encodings, in a system

+is when <i>inbuf</i> is not NULL and <i>*inbuf</i> is not
+NULL. In this case, the <b>iconv</b> function converts the
+multibyte sequence starting at <i>*inbuf</i> to a multibyte
+sequence starting at <i>*outbuf</i>. At most
+<i>*inbytesleft</i> bytes, starting at <i>*inbuf</i>, will
+be read. At most <i>*outbytesleft</i> bytes, starting at
+<i>*outbuf</i>, will be written.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
+<b>iconv</b> function converts one multibyte character at a
+time, and for each character conversion it increments
+<i>*inbuf</i> and decrements <i>*inbytesleft</i> by the
+number of converted input bytes, it increments
+<i>*outbuf</i> and decrements <i>*outbytesleft</i> by the
+number of converted output bytes, and it updates the
+conversion state contained in <i>cd</i>. If the character
+encoding of the input is stateful, the <b>iconv</b> function
+can also convert a sequence of input bytes to an update of
+the conversion state without producing any output bytes;
+such input is called a <i>shift sequence</i>. The conversion
+can stop for four reasons:</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. An invalid
+multibyte sequence is encountered in the input. In this case
+it sets <b>errno</b> to <b>EILSEQ</b> and returns
+(size_t)(&minus;1). <i>*inbuf</i> is left pointing to the
+beginning of the invalid multibyte sequence.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. The input
+byte sequence has been entirely converted, i.e.
+<i>*inbytesleft</i> has gone down to 0. In this case
+<b>iconv</b> returns the number of non-reversible
+conversions performed during this call.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. An
+incomplete multibyte sequence is encountered in the input,
+and the input byte sequence terminates after it. In this
+case it sets <b>errno</b> to <b>EINVAL</b> and returns
+(size_t)(&minus;1). <i>*inbuf</i> is left pointing to the
+beginning of the incomplete multibyte sequence.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. The output
+buffer has no more room for the next converted character. In
+this case it sets <b>errno</b> to <b>E2BIG</b> and returns
+(size_t)(&minus;1).</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A different
+case is when <i>inbuf</i> is NULL or <i>*inbuf</i> is NULL,
+but <i>outbuf</i> is not NULL and <i>*outbuf</i> is not
+NULL. In this case, the <b>iconv</b> function attempts to
+set <i>cd</i>&rsquo;s conversion state to the initial state
+and store a corresponding shift sequence at <i>*outbuf</i>.
+At most <i>*outbytesleft</i> bytes, starting at
+<i>*outbuf</i>, will be written. If the output buffer has no
+more room for this reset sequence, it sets <b>errno</b> to
+<b>E2BIG</b> and returns (size_t)(&minus;1). Otherwise it
+increments <i>*outbuf</i> and decrements
+<i>*outbytesleft</i> by the number of bytes written.</p>
+
+<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A third case is
+when <i>inbuf</i> is NULL or <i>*inbuf</i> is NULL, and
+<i>outbuf</i> is NULL or <i>*outbuf</i> is NULL. In this
+case, the <b>iconv</b> function sets <i>cd</i>&rsquo;s
+conversion state to the initial state.</p>

+\`configure' configures this package to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:

+  --with-sysroot=DIR Search for dependent libraries within DIR
+                        (or the compiler's sysroot if not specified).
+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+
+   Programs that use <stdbool.h> should be aware of some limitations
+   and standards compliance issues.
+
+   Standards compliance:
+
+       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before 'bool', 'false', 'true'
+         can be used.
+
+       - You cannot assume that sizeof (bool) == 1.
+
+       - Programs should not undefine the macros bool, true, and false,
+         as C99 lists that as an "obsolescent feature".
+
+   Limitations of this substitute, when used in a C89 environment:
+
+       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before the '_Bool' type can be used.
+
+       - You cannot assume that _Bool is a typedef; it might be a macro.
+
+       - Bit-fields of type 'bool' are not supported.  Portable code
+         should use 'unsigned int foo : 1;' rather than 'bool foo : 1;'.
+
+       - In C99, casts and automatic conversions to '_Bool' or 'bool' are
+         performed in such a way that every nonzero value gets converted
+         to 'true', and zero gets converted to 'false'.  This doesn't work
+         with this substitute.  With this substitute, only the values 0 and 1
+         give the expected result when converted to _Bool' or 'bool'.
+
+       - C99 allows the use of (_Bool)0.0 in constant expressions, but
+         this substitute cannot always provide this property.
+
+   Also, it is suggested that programs use 'bool' rather than '_Bool';

+/* Set up the following warnings, based on which modules are in use.
+   GNU Coding Standards discourage the use of fseek, since it imposes
+   an arbitrary limitation on some 32-bit hosts.  Remember that the
+   fseek module depends on the fseeko module, so we only have three
+   cases to consider:
+
+   1. The developer is not using either module.  Issue a warning under
+   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK for both functions, to remind them that both
+   functions have bugs on some systems.  _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES has no
+   impact on this warning.
+
+   2. The developer is using both modules.  They may be unaware of the
+   arbitrary limitations of fseek, so issue a warning under
+   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK.  On the other hand, they may be using both
+   modules intentionally, so the developer can define
+   _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES in the compilation units where the use of fseek
+   is safe, to silence the warning.
+
+   3. The developer is using the fseeko module, but not fseek.  Gnulib
+   guarantees that fseek will still work around platform bugs in that
+   case, but we presume that the developer is aware of the pitfalls of
+   fseek and was trying to avoid it, so issue a warning even when
+   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK is undefined.  Again, _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES can be
+   defined to silence the warning in particular compilation units.
+   In C++ compilations with GNULIB_NAMESPACE, in order to avoid that
+   fseek gets defined as a macro, it is recommended that the developer
+   uses the fseek module, even if he is not calling the fseek function.
+
+   Most gnulib clients that perform stream operations should fall into

+/* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
+   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
+   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.
+
+   If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
+   _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
+   that is an operand of sizeof.
+
+   The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
+   compilers that do not support _Static_assert:
+
+   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
+     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
+     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
+     constant and nonnegative.
+
+   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
+     struct _gl_verify_type {
+       unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
+     }.
+     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
+     deal with a bit-field of negative size.
+
+     One might think that an array size check would have the same
+     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
+     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
+     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
+     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
+     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
+     the verify macro:
+
+       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }
+
+   * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
+     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
+     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
+     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
+     such as in
+
+       struct dummy {...};
+       typedef struct {...} dummy;
+       extern struct {...} *dummy;
+       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
+       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);
+
+     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
+     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
+     attach the current line number to the entity name:
+
+       #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
+       #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
+       extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);
+
+     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
+     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
+     would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
+     macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)
+
+     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
+     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like
+
+       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
+       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
+       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
+
+     can be repeated.
+
+   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
+     Which of the following alternatives can be used?
+
+       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
+       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
+       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
+       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
+       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
+       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
+
+     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
+     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
+     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
+     possibility is the fifth case:
+
+       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
+
+   * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
+     -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
+     __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
+     each dummy function, to suppress this warning.
+
+   * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
+     which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
+     last declaration mentioned above.
+
+   * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and verify() is used
+     within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
+     arrange to use verify_expr() instead.
+
+   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
+     Use a template type to work around the problem.  */

+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
+   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress the use of extern inline on Apple's platforms, as Libc at least
+   through Libc-825.26 (2013-04-09) is incompatible with it; see, e.g.,
+   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html>.
+   Perhaps Apple will fix this some day.  */

+
+dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
+
+dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
+dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
+dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
+dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
+dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
+dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
+dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
+dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
+dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
+dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
+dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
+dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
+dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
+dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
+dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
+dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
+dnl    the value '$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
+dnl
+dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
+dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
+dnl    and used.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
+dnl    Catalog format: none
+dnl    Catalog extension: none
+dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
+dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
+dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
+dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
+dnl maintainers.

+dnl Sets INCLUDE_NEXT and PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER.
+dnl
+dnl INCLUDE_NEXT expands to 'include_next' if the compiler supports it, or to
+dnl 'include' otherwise.
+dnl
+dnl INCLUDE_NEXT_AS_FIRST_DIRECTIVE expands to 'include_next' if the compiler
+dnl supports it in the special case that it is the first include directive in
+dnl the given file, or to 'include' otherwise.
+dnl
+dnl PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER can be used in files that contain #include_next,
+dnl so as to avoid GCC warnings when the gcc option -pedantic is used.
+dnl '#pragma GCC system_header' has the same effect as if the file was found
+dnl through the include search path specified with '-isystem' options (as
+dnl opposed to the search path specified with '-I' options). Namely, gcc
+dnl does not warn about some things, and on some systems (Solaris and Interix)
+dnl __STDC__ evaluates to 0 instead of to 1. The latter is an undesired side
+dnl effect; we are therefore careful to use 'defined __STDC__' or '1' instead
+dnl of plain '__STDC__'.
+dnl
+dnl PRAGMA_COLUMNS can be used in files that override system header files, so
+dnl as to avoid compilation errors on HP NonStop systems when the gnulib file
+dnl is included by a system header file that does a "#pragma COLUMNS 80" (which
+dnl has the effect of truncating the lines of that file and all files that it
+dnl includes to 80 columns) and the gnulib file has lines longer than 80
+dnl columns.

+# gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE(INCLUDES, NAMES)
+# ---------------------------------------
+# For each whitespace-separated element in the list of NAMES, define
+# HAVE_RAW_DECL_name if the function has a declaration among INCLUDES
+# even after being undefined as a macro.
+#
+# See warn-on-use.h for some hints on how to poison function names, as
+# well as ideas on poisoning global variables and macros.  NAMES may
+# include global variables, but remember that only functions work with
+# _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  Typically, INCLUDES only needs to list a single
+# header, but if the replacement header pulls in other headers because
+# some systems declare functions in the wrong header, then INCLUDES
+# should do likewise.
+#
+# It is generally safe to assume declarations for functions declared
+# in the intersection of C89 and C11 (such as printf) without
+# needing gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE.
