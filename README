OpenELEC - Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center

OpenELEC runs XBMC, an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media 
player and entertainment hub for digital media (http://xbmc.org).
The base system has been designed and built from the ground up to be as 
efficient as possible – consuming only a tiny footprint, cutting edge hardware 
support for a set-top box experience.

Source code:
- https://github.com/OpenELEC/OpenELEC.tv

Installation:

License:
- OpenELEC is released under GPLv2. Please refer to the "licenses" folder and 
  source code for clarification on upstream licensing.

Copyright:
- Since OpenELEC includes code from many up stream projects it includes many 
  copyright owners. OpenELEC makes NO claim of copyright on any upstream code. 
  However all OpenELEC authored code is copyright openelec.tv.
  For a complete copyright list checkout the source code to examine the headers.
  Unless expressly stated otherwise all code submitted DIRECTLY to the OpenELEC 
  project (in any form) is licensed under GPLv2 and the Copyright is donated to 
  openelec.tv.
  This allows the project to stay manageable in the long term by giving us the
  freedom to maintain the code as part of the whole without the management 
  overhead of preserving contact with every submitter ever e.g. move to GPLv3.
  You are absolutely free to retain copyright. To retain copyright simply add a 
  copyright header to every submitted code page.
  If you are submitting code that is not your own work it is the submitters

Notes:
- Login details for SSH are user: “root” password: “openelec”.
  SSH allows command line access to your openelec.tv machine for configuration
  and file transfer. Linux/mac clients can natively use SSH, windows users 
  might want to try PuTTY for their terminal access.
- $HOME is mounted on /storage (the second ext4 partition on the drive). 
  All data transfered to the machine will go here, the rest of the system is
  read-only with the exception of /var (containing runtime configuration data).
- Manual update/downgrade procedure is as follows:
  Extract the snapshot and navigate to the 'target' directory.
  Copy KERNEL and SYSTEM to the 'Update' network share (or /storage/.update) on
  your openelec machine. Your system will automatically upgrade during the 
  next reboot.
- Automatic mounting of filesystems is supported. Devices such as USB Flash 
  sticks can be plugged into a running machine and will be mounted to /media,
  showing up in xbmc’s GUI.
- Comments and questions are more than welcome, help is even better and patches 
  are absolutely perfect!!
