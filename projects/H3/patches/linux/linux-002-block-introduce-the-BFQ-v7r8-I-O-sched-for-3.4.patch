Subject: [PATCH 2/3] block: introduce the BFQ-v7r8 I/O sched for 3.4

Add the BFQ-v7r8 I/O scheduler to 3.4.
The general structure is borrowed from CFQ, as much of the code for
handling I/O contexts. Over time, several useful features have been
ported from CFQ as well (details in the changelog in README.BFQ). A
(bfq_)queue is associated to each task doing I/O on a device, and each
time a scheduling decision has to be made a queue is selected and served
until it expires.

    - Slices are given in the service domain: tasks are assigned
      budgets, measured in number of sectors. Once got the disk, a task
      must however consume its assigned budget within a configurable
      maximum time (by default, the maximum possible value of the
      budgets is automatically computed to comply with this timeout).
      This allows the desired latency vs "throughput boosting" tradeoff
      to be set.

    - Budgets are scheduled according to a variant of WF2Q+, implemented
      using an augmented rb-tree to take eligibility into account while
      preserving an O(log N) overall complexity.

    - A low-latency tunable is provided; if enabled, both interactive
      and soft real-time applications are guaranteed a very low latency.

    - Latency guarantees are preserved also in the presence of NCQ.

    - Also with flash-based devices, a high throughput is achieved
      while still preserving latency guarantees.

    - BFQ features Early Queue Merge (EQM), a sort of fusion of the
      cooperating-queue-merging and the preemption mechanisms present
      in CFQ. EQM is in fact a unified mechanism that tries to get a
      sequential read pattern, and hence a high throughput, with any
      set of processes performing interleaved I/O over a contiguous
      sequence of sectors.

    - BFQ supports full hierarchical scheduling, exporting a cgroups
      interface.  Since each node has a full scheduler, each group can
      be assigned its own weight.

    - If the cgroups interface is not used, only I/O priorities can be
      assigned to processes, with ioprio values mapped to weights
      with the relation weight = IOPRIO_BE_NR - ioprio.

    - ioprio classes are served in strict priority order, i.e., lower
      priority queues are not served as long as there are higher
      priority queues.  Among queues in the same class the bandwidth is
      distributed in proportion to the weight of each queue. A very
      thin extra bandwidth is however guaranteed to the Idle class, to
      prevent it from starving.

+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based on
+ * the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns budgets,
+ * measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of time slices. The
+ * device is not granted to the in-service process for a given time slice,
+ * but until it has exhausted its assigned budget. This change from the time
+ * to the service domain allows BFQ to distribute the device throughput
+ * among processes as desired, without any distortion due to ZBR, workload
+ * fluctuations or other factors. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler,
+ * called B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated to processes. Thanks to the
+ * accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high budgets to
+ * I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to boost the
+ * throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to interactive and soft
+ * real-time applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial, more
+ * theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader can find
+ * in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as well as
+ * formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the properties.
+ * With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these papers, this
+ * implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the one that
+ * guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications, and a
+ * hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * If many queues happen to become active shortly after each other, then,
+ * to help the processes associated to these queues get their job done as
+ * soon as possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to these queues. In this comment we describe, firstly,
+ * the reasons why this fact holds, and, secondly, the next function, which
+ * implements the main steps needed to properly mark these queues so that
+ * they can then be treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * As for the terminology, we say that a queue becomes active, i.e.,
+ * switches from idle to backlogged, either when it is created (as a
+ * consequence of the arrival of an I/O request), or, if already existing,
+ * when a new request for the queue arrives while the queue is idle.
+ * Bursts of activations, i.e., activations of different queues occurring
+ * shortly after each other, are typically caused by services or applications
+ * that spawn or reactivate many parallel threads/processes. Examples are
+ * systemd during boot or git grep.
+ *
+ * These services or applications benefit mostly from a high throughput:
+ * the quicker the requests of the activated queues are cumulatively served,
+ * the sooner the target job of these queues gets completed. As a consequence,
+ * weight-raising any of these queues, which also implies idling the device
+ * for it, is almost always counterproductive: in most cases it just lowers
+ * throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of activations may be also caused by the start
+ * of an application that does not consist in a lot of parallel I/O-bound
+ * threads. In fact, with a complex application, the burst may be just a
+ * consequence of the fact that several processes need to be executed to
+ * start-up the application. To start an application as quickly as possible,
+ * the best thing to do is to privilege the I/O related to the application
+ * with respect to all other I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as
+ * quickly as possible an application that causes a burst of activations is
+ * to weight-raise all the queues activated during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the two
+ * types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this seems
+ * relatively easy to do, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that bursts with a larger size
+ * than that threshold are apparently caused only by services or commands
+ * such as systemd or git grep. For brevity, hereafter we call just 'large'
+ * these bursts. BFQ *does not* weight-raise queues whose activations occur
+ * in a large burst. In addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or
+ * does not perform idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput
+ * most. The exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps needed
+ * to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly mark all the
+ * queues belonging to it (so that they can then be treated in a different
+ * way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a special "burst list" that
+ * holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the burst in progress. The
+ * list is then used to mark these queues as belonging to a large burst if
+ * the burst does become large. The main steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is activated, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is activated while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is activated a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy application may happen to behave in an
+ * isochronous way if the CPU load is high. In fact, the application may
+ * stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy serving other processes,
+ * then restart, then stop again for a while, and so on. In addition, if
+ * the disk achieves a low enough throughput with the request pattern
+ * issued by the application (e.g., because the request pattern is random
+ * and/or the device is slow), then the application may meet the above
+ * bandwidth requirement too. To prevent such a greedy application to be
+ * deemed as soft real-time, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: soft_rt_next_start must be higher than the current
+ * time plus the maximum time for which the arrival of a request is waited
+ * for when a sync queue becomes idle, namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle.
+ * This filters out greedy applications, as the latter issue instead their
+ * next request as soon as possible after the last one has been completed
+ * (in contrast, when a batch of requests is completed, a soft real-time
+ * application spends some time processing data).
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, the last filter may easily generate false positives if
+ * only bfqd->bfq_slice_idle is used as a reference time interval and one
+ * or both the following cases occur:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or higher
+ *    than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow devices with
+ *    HZ=100.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, we do not use as a reference time interval just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In
+ * particular we add the minimum number of jiffies for which the filter

+ * Device idling is allowed only for the queues for which this function
+ * returns true. For this reason, the return value of this function plays a
+ * critical role for both throughput boosting and service guarantees. The
+ * return value is computed through a logical expression. In this rather
+ * long comment, we try to briefly describe all the details and motivations
+ * behind the components of this logical expression.
+ *
+ * First, the expression is false if bfqq is not sync, or if: bfqq happened
+ * to become active during a large burst of queue activations, and the
+ * pattern of requests bfqq contains boosts the throughput if bfqq is
+ * expired. In fact, queues that became active during a large burst benefit
+ * only from throughput, as discussed in the comments to bfq_handle_burst.
+ * In this respect, expiring bfqq certainly boosts the throughput on NCQ-
+ * capable flash-based devices, whereas, on rotational devices, it boosts
+ * the throughput only if bfqq contains random requests.
+ *
+ * On the opposite end, if (a) bfqq is sync, (b) the above burst-related
+ * condition does not hold, and (c) bfqq is being weight-raised, then the
+ * expression always evaluates to true, as device idling is instrumental
+ * for preserving low-latency guarantees (see [1]). If, instead, conditions
+ * (a) and (b) do hold, but (c) does not, then the expression evaluates to
+ * true only if: (1) bfqq is I/O-bound and has a non-null idle window, and
+ * (2) at least one of the following two conditions holds.
+ * The first condition is that the device is not performing NCQ, because
+ * idling the device most certainly boosts the throughput if this condition
+ * holds and bfqq is I/O-bound and has been granted a non-null idle window.
+ * The second compound condition is made of the logical AND of two components.
+ *
+ * The first component is true only if there is no weight-raised busy
+ * queue. This guarantees that the device is not idled for a sync non-
+ * weight-raised queue when there are busy weight-raised queues. The former
+ * is then expired immediately if empty. Combined with the timestamping
+ * rules of BFQ (see [1] for details), this causes sync non-weight-raised
+ * queues to get a lower number of requests served, and hence to ask for a
+ * lower number of requests from the request pool, before the busy weight-
+ * raised queues get served again.
+ *
+ * This is beneficial for the processes associated with weight-raised
+ * queues, when the request pool is saturated (e.g., in the presence of
+ * write hogs). In fact, if the processes associated with the other queues
+ * ask for requests at a lower rate, then weight-raised processes have a
+ * higher probability to get a request from the pool immediately (or at
+ * least soon) when they need one. Hence they have a higher probability to
+ * actually get a fraction of the disk throughput proportional to their
+ * high weight. This is especially true with NCQ-capable drives, which
+ * enqueue several requests in advance and further reorder internally-
+ * queued requests.
+ *
+ * In the end, mistreating non-weight-raised queues when there are busy
+ * weight-raised queues seems to mitigate starvation problems in the
+ * presence of heavy write workloads and NCQ, and hence to guarantee a
+ * higher application and system responsiveness in these hostile scenarios.
+ *
+ * If the first component of the compound condition is instead true, i.e.,
+ * there is no weight-raised busy queue, then the second component of the
+ * compound condition takes into account service-guarantee and throughput
+ * issues related to NCQ (recall that the compound condition is evaluated
+ * only if the device is detected as supporting NCQ).
+ *
+ * As for service guarantees, allowing the drive to enqueue more than one
+ * request at a time, and hence delegating de facto final scheduling
+ * decisions to the drive's internal scheduler, causes loss of control on
+ * the actual request service order. In this respect, when the drive is
+ * allowed to enqueue more than one request at a time, the service
+ * distribution enforced by the drive's internal scheduler is likely to
+ * coincide with the desired device-throughput distribution only in the
+ * following, perfectly symmetric, scenario:
+ * 1) all active queues have the same weight,
+ * 2) all active groups at the same level in the groups tree have the same
+ *    weight,
+ * 3) all active groups at the same level in the groups tree have the same
+ *    number of children.
+ *
+ * Even in such a scenario, sequential I/O may still receive a preferential
+ * treatment, but this is not likely to be a big issue with flash-based
+ * devices, because of their non-dramatic loss of throughput with random
+ * I/O. Things do differ with HDDs, for which additional care is taken, as
+ * explained after completing the discussion for flash-based devices.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, keeping the necessary state for evaluating exactly the
+ * above symmetry conditions would be quite complex and time-consuming.
+ * Therefore BFQ evaluates instead the following stronger sub-conditions,
+ * for which it is much easier to maintain the needed state:
+ * 1) all active queues have the same weight,
+ * 2) all active groups have the same weight,
+ * 3) all active groups have at most one active child each.
+ * In particular, the last two conditions are always true if hierarchical
+ * support and the cgroups interface are not enabled, hence no state needs
+ * to be maintained in this case.
+ *
+ * According to the above considerations, the second component of the
+ * compound condition evaluates to true if any of the above symmetry
+ * sub-condition does not hold, or the device is not flash-based. Therefore,
+ * if also the first component is true, then idling is allowed for a sync
+ * queue. These are the only sub-conditions considered if the device is
+ * flash-based, as, for such a device, it is sensible to force idling only
+ * for service-guarantee issues. In fact, as for throughput, idling
+ * NCQ-capable flash-based devices would not boost the throughput even
+ * with sequential I/O; rather it would lower the throughput in proportion
+ * to how fast the device is. In the end, (only) if all the three
+ * sub-conditions hold and the device is flash-based, the compound
+ * condition evaluates to false and therefore no idling is performed.
+ *
+ * As already said, things change with a rotational device, where idling
+ * boosts the throughput with sequential I/O (even with NCQ). Hence, for
+ * such a device the second component of the compound condition evaluates
+ * to true also if the following additional sub-condition does not hold:
+ * the queue is constantly seeky. Unfortunately, this different behavior
+ * with respect to flash-based devices causes an additional asymmetry: if
+ * some sync queues enjoy idling and some other sync queues do not, then
+ * the latter get a low share of the device throughput, simply because the
+ * former get many requests served after being set as in service, whereas
+ * the latter do not. As a consequence, to guarantee the desired throughput
+ * distribution, on HDDs the compound expression evaluates to true (and
+ * hence device idling is performed) also if the following last symmetry
+ * condition does not hold: no other queue is benefiting from idling. Also
+ * this last condition is actually replaced with a simpler-to-maintain and
+ * stronger condition: there is no busy queue which is not constantly seeky
+ * (and hence may also benefit from idling).
+ *
+ * To sum up, when all the required symmetry and throughput-boosting
+ * sub-conditions hold, the second component of the compound condition
+ * evaluates to false, and hence no idling is performed. This helps to
+ * keep the drives' internal queues full on NCQ-capable devices, and hence
+ * to boost the throughput, without causing 'almost' any loss of service
+ * guarantees. The 'almost' follows from the fact that, if the internal
+ * queue of one such device is filled while all the sub-conditions hold,
+ * but at some point in time some sub-condition stops to hold, then it may
+ * become impossible to let requests be served in the new desired order
+ * until all the requests already queued in the device have been served.

+ * @min_start: minimum start time of the (active) subtree rooted at
+ *             this entity; used for O(log N) lookups into active trees.
+ * @service: service received during the last round of service.
+ * @budget: budget used to calculate F_i; F_i = S_i + @budget / @weight.
+ * @weight: weight of the queue
+ * @parent: parent entity, for hierarchical scheduling.
+ * @my_sched_data: for non-leaf nodes in the cgroup hierarchy, the
+ *                 associated scheduler queue, %NULL on leaf nodes.
+ * @sched_data: the scheduler queue this entity belongs to.
+ * @ioprio: the ioprio in use.
+ * @new_weight: when a weight change is requested, the new weight value.
+ * @orig_weight: original weight, used to implement weight boosting
+ * @new_ioprio: when an ioprio change is requested, the new ioprio value.
+ * @ioprio_class: the ioprio_class in use.
+ * @new_ioprio_class: when an ioprio_class change is requested, the new
+ *                    ioprio_class value.
+ * @ioprio_changed: flag, true when the user requested a weight, ioprio or
+ *                  ioprio_class change.
+ *
+ * A bfq_entity is used to represent either a bfq_queue (leaf node in the
+ * cgroup hierarchy) or a bfq_group into the upper level scheduler.  Each
+ * entity belongs to the sched_data of the parent group in the cgroup
+ * hierarchy.  Non-leaf entities have also their own sched_data, stored
+ * in @my_sched_data.
+ *
+ * Each entity stores independently its priority values; this would
+ * allow different weights on different devices, but this
+ * functionality is not exported to userspace by now.  Priorities and
+ * weights are updated lazily, first storing the new values into the
+ * new_* fields, then setting the @ioprio_changed flag.  As soon as
+ * there is a transition in the entity state that allows the priority
+ * update to take place the effective and the requested priority
+ * values are synchronized.
+ *
+ * Unless cgroups are used, the weight value is calculated from the
+ * ioprio to export the same interface as CFQ.  When dealing with
+ * ``well-behaved'' queues (i.e., queues that do not spend too much
+ * time to consume their budget and have true sequential behavior, and
+ * when there are no external factors breaking anticipation) the
+ * relative weights at each level of the cgroups hierarchy should be
+ * guaranteed.  All the fields are protected by the queue lock of the
+ * containing bfqd.
