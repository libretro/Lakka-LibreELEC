Subject: [PATCH 08/16] Reorder libraries in configure script to prevent
 linker errors when linking with libsmbclient

Place libsmbclient before all other libraries to prevent linker errors when linking
with libsmbclient if the libc that is currently used doesn't contain some functions
such as dn_expand (which are often included in libc), but are actually included in
libresolv.
