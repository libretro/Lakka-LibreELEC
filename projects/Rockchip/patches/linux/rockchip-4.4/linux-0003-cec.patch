+CEC Kernel Support
+==================
+
+The CEC framework provides a unified kernel interface for use with HDMI CEC
+hardware. It is designed to handle a multiple types of hardware (receivers,
+transmitters, USB dongles). The framework also gives the option to decide
+what to do in the kernel driver and what should be handled by userspace
+applications. In addition it integrates the remote control passthrough
+feature into the kernel's remote control framework.
+
+
+The CEC Protocol
+----------------
+
+The CEC protocol enables consumer electronic devices to communicate with each
+other through the HDMI connection. The protocol uses logical addresses in the
+communication. The logical address is strictly connected with the functionality
+provided by the device. The TV acting as the communication hub is always
+assigned address 0. The physical address is determined by the physical
+connection between devices.
+
+The CEC framework described here is up to date with the CEC 2.0 specification.
+It is documented in the HDMI 1.4 specification with the new 2.0 bits documented
+in the HDMI 2.0 specification. But for most of the features the freely available
+HDMI 1.3a specification is sufficient:
+
+http://www.microprocessor.org/HDMISpecification13a.pdf
+
+
+CEC Adapter Interface
+---------------------
+
+The struct cec_adapter represents the CEC adapter hardware. It is created by
+calling cec_allocate_adapter() and deleted by calling cec_delete_adapter():
+
+.. c:function::
+   struct cec_adapter *cec_allocate_adapter(const struct cec_adap_ops *ops, void *priv,
+   const char *name, u32 caps, u8 available_las);
+
+.. c:function::
+   void cec_delete_adapter(struct cec_adapter *adap);
+
+To create an adapter you need to pass the following information:
+
+ops:
+	adapter operations which are called by the CEC framework and that you
+	have to implement.
+
+priv:
+	will be stored in adap->priv and can be used by the adapter ops.
+	Use cec_get_drvdata(adap) to get the priv pointer.
+
+name:
+	the name of the CEC adapter. Note: this name will be copied.
+
+caps:
+	capabilities of the CEC adapter. These capabilities determine the
+	capabilities of the hardware and which parts are to be handled
+	by userspace and which parts are handled by kernelspace. The
+	capabilities are returned by CEC_ADAP_G_CAPS.
+
+available_las:
+	the number of simultaneous logical addresses that this
+	adapter can handle. Must be 1 <= available_las <= CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS.
+
+To obtain the priv pointer use this helper function:
+
+.. c:function::
+	void *cec_get_drvdata(const struct cec_adapter *adap);
+
+To register the /dev/cecX device node and the remote control device (if
+CEC_CAP_RC is set) you call:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int cec_register_adapter(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct device *parent);
+
+where parent is the parent device.
+
+To unregister the devices call:
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_unregister_adapter(struct cec_adapter *adap);
+
+Note: if cec_register_adapter() fails, then call cec_delete_adapter() to
+clean up. But if cec_register_adapter() succeeded, then only call
+cec_unregister_adapter() to clean up, never cec_delete_adapter(). The
+unregister function will delete the adapter automatically once the last user
+of that /dev/cecX device has closed its file handle.
+
+
+Implementing the Low-Level CEC Adapter
+--------------------------------------
+
+The following low-level adapter operations have to be implemented in
+your driver:
+
+.. c:type:: struct cec_adap_ops
+
+.. code-block:: none
+
+	struct cec_adap_ops
+	{
+		/* Low-level callbacks */
+		int (*adap_enable)(struct cec_adapter *adap, bool enable);
+		int (*adap_monitor_all_enable)(struct cec_adapter *adap, bool enable);
+		int (*adap_log_addr)(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 logical_addr);
+		int (*adap_transmit)(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 attempts,
+				      u32 signal_free_time, struct cec_msg *msg);
+		void (*adap_status)(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct seq_file *file);
+
+		/* High-level callbacks */
+		...
+	};
+
+The five low-level ops deal with various aspects of controlling the CEC adapter
+hardware:
+
+
+To enable/disable the hardware:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int (*adap_enable)(struct cec_adapter *adap, bool enable);
+
+This callback enables or disables the CEC hardware. Enabling the CEC hardware
+means powering it up in a state where no logical addresses are claimed. This
+op assumes that the physical address (adap->phys_addr) is valid when enable is
+true and will not change while the CEC adapter remains enabled. The initial
+state of the CEC adapter after calling cec_allocate_adapter() is disabled.
+
+Note that adap_enable must return 0 if enable is false.
+
+
+To enable/disable the 'monitor all' mode:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int (*adap_monitor_all_enable)(struct cec_adapter *adap, bool enable);
+
+If enabled, then the adapter should be put in a mode to also monitor messages
+that not for us. Not all hardware supports this and this function is only
+called if the CEC_CAP_MONITOR_ALL capability is set. This callback is optional
+(some hardware may always be in 'monitor all' mode).
+
+Note that adap_monitor_all_enable must return 0 if enable is false.
+
+
+To program a new logical address:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int (*adap_log_addr)(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 logical_addr);
+
+If logical_addr == CEC_LOG_ADDR_INVALID then all programmed logical addresses
+are to be erased. Otherwise the given logical address should be programmed.
+If the maximum number of available logical addresses is exceeded, then it
+should return -ENXIO. Once a logical address is programmed the CEC hardware
+can receive directed messages to that address.
+
+Note that adap_log_addr must return 0 if logical_addr is CEC_LOG_ADDR_INVALID.
+
+
+To transmit a new message:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int (*adap_transmit)(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 attempts,
+			     u32 signal_free_time, struct cec_msg *msg);
+
+This transmits a new message. The attempts argument is the suggested number of
+attempts for the transmit.
+
+The signal_free_time is the number of data bit periods that the adapter should
+wait when the line is free before attempting to send a message. This value
+depends on whether this transmit is a retry, a message from a new initiator or
+a new message for the same initiator. Most hardware will handle this
+automatically, but in some cases this information is needed.
+
+The CEC_FREE_TIME_TO_USEC macro can be used to convert signal_free_time to
+microseconds (one data bit period is 2.4 ms).
+
+
+To log the current CEC hardware status:
+
+.. c:function::
+	void (*adap_status)(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct seq_file *file);
+
+This optional callback can be used to show the status of the CEC hardware.
+The status is available through debugfs: cat /sys/kernel/debug/cec/cecX/status
+
+
+Your adapter driver will also have to react to events (typically interrupt
+driven) by calling into the framework in the following situations:
+
+When a transmit finished (successfully or otherwise):
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_transmit_done(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 status, u8 arb_lost_cnt,
+		       u8 nack_cnt, u8 low_drive_cnt, u8 error_cnt);
+
+or:
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_transmit_attempt_done(struct cec_adapter *adap, u8 status);
+
+The status can be one of:
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_OK:
+	the transmit was successful.
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_ARB_LOST:
+	arbitration was lost: another CEC initiator
+	took control of the CEC line and you lost the arbitration.
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_NACK:
+	the message was nacked (for a directed message) or
+	acked (for a broadcast message). A retransmission is needed.
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_LOW_DRIVE:
+	low drive was detected on the CEC bus. This indicates that
+	a follower detected an error on the bus and requested a
+	retransmission.
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_ERROR:
+	some unspecified error occurred: this can be one of
+	the previous two if the hardware cannot differentiate or something
+	else entirely.
+
+CEC_TX_STATUS_MAX_RETRIES:
+	could not transmit the message after trying multiple times.
+	Should only be set by the driver if it has hardware support for
+	retrying messages. If set, then the framework assumes that it
+	doesn't have to make another attempt to transmit the message
+	since the hardware did that already.
+
+The \*_cnt arguments are the number of error conditions that were seen.
+This may be 0 if no information is available. Drivers that do not support
+hardware retry can just set the counter corresponding to the transmit error
+to 1, if the hardware does support retry then either set these counters to
+0 if the hardware provides no feedback of which errors occurred and how many
+times, or fill in the correct values as reported by the hardware.
+
+The cec_transmit_attempt_done() function is a helper for cases where the
+hardware never retries, so the transmit is always for just a single
+attempt. It will call cec_transmit_done() in turn, filling in 1 for the
+count argument corresponding to the status. Or all 0 if the status was OK.
+
+When a CEC message was received:
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_received_msg(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct cec_msg *msg);
+
+Speaks for itself.
+
+Implementing the interrupt handler
+----------------------------------
+
+Typically the CEC hardware provides interrupts that signal when a transmit
+finished and whether it was successful or not, and it provides and interrupt
+when a CEC message was received.
+
+The CEC driver should always process the transmit interrupts first before
+handling the receive interrupt. The framework expects to see the cec_transmit_done
+call before the cec_received_msg call, otherwise it can get confused if the
+received message was in reply to the transmitted message.
+
+Implementing the High-Level CEC Adapter
+---------------------------------------
+
+The low-level operations drive the hardware, the high-level operations are
+CEC protocol driven. The following high-level callbacks are available:
+
+.. code-block:: none
+
+	struct cec_adap_ops {
+		/* Low-level callbacks */
+		...
+
+		/* High-level CEC message callback */
+		int (*received)(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct cec_msg *msg);
+	};
+
+The received() callback allows the driver to optionally handle a newly
+received CEC message
+
+.. c:function::
+	int (*received)(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct cec_msg *msg);
+
+If the driver wants to process a CEC message, then it can implement this
+callback. If it doesn't want to handle this message, then it should return
+-ENOMSG, otherwise the CEC framework assumes it processed this message and
+it will not do anything with it.
+
+
+CEC framework functions
+-----------------------
+
+CEC Adapter drivers can call the following CEC framework functions:
+
+.. c:function::
+	int cec_transmit_msg(struct cec_adapter *adap, struct cec_msg *msg,
+			     bool block);
+
+Transmit a CEC message. If block is true, then wait until the message has been
+transmitted, otherwise just queue it and return.
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_s_phys_addr(struct cec_adapter *adap, u16 phys_addr,
+			     bool block);
+
+Change the physical address. This function will set adap->phys_addr and
+send an event if it has changed. If cec_s_log_addrs() has been called and
+the physical address has become valid, then the CEC framework will start
+claiming the logical addresses. If block is true, then this function won't
+return until this process has finished.
+
+When the physical address is set to a valid value the CEC adapter will
+be enabled (see the adap_enable op). When it is set to CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID,
+then the CEC adapter will be disabled. If you change a valid physical address
+to another valid physical address, then this function will first set the
+address to CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID before enabling the new physical address.
+
+.. c:function::
+	void cec_s_phys_addr_from_edid(struct cec_adapter *adap,
+				       const struct edid *edid);
+
+A helper function that extracts the physical address from the edid struct
+and calls cec_s_phys_addr() with that address, or CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID
+if the EDID did not contain a physical address or edid was a NULL pointer.
+
+.. c:function::
+	int cec_s_log_addrs(struct cec_adapter *adap,
+			    struct cec_log_addrs *log_addrs, bool block);
+
+Claim the CEC logical addresses. Should never be called if CEC_CAP_LOG_ADDRS
+is set. If block is true, then wait until the logical addresses have been
+claimed, otherwise just queue it and return. To unconfigure all logical
+addresses call this function with log_addrs set to NULL or with
+log_addrs->num_log_addrs set to 0. The block argument is ignored when
+unconfiguring. This function will just return if the physical address is
+invalid. Once the physical address becomes valid, then the framework will
+attempt to claim these logical addresses.

+
+
+Description
+===========
+
+The :c:func:`ioctl()` function manipulates cec device parameters. The
+argument ``fd`` must be an open file descriptor.
+
+The ioctl ``request`` code specifies the cec function to be called. It
+has encoded in it whether the argument is an input, output or read/write
+parameter, and the size of the argument ``argp`` in bytes.
+
+Macros and structures definitions specifying cec ioctl requests and
+their parameters are located in the cec.h header file. All cec ioctl
+requests, their respective function and parameters are specified in
+:ref:`cec-user-func`.
+
+
+Return Value
+============
+
+On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
+appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
+:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
+

+
+
+Description
+===========
+
+With the :c:func:`poll()` function applications can wait for CEC
+events.
+
+On success :c:func:`poll()` returns the number of file descriptors
+that have been selected (that is, file descriptors for which the
+``revents`` field of the respective struct :c:type:`pollfd`
+is non-zero). CEC devices set the ``POLLIN`` and ``POLLRDNORM`` flags in
+the ``revents`` field if there are messages in the receive queue. If the
+transmit queue has room for new messages, the ``POLLOUT`` and
+``POLLWRNORM`` flags are set. If there are events in the event queue,
+then the ``POLLPRI`` flag is set. When the function times out it returns
+a value of zero, on failure it returns -1 and the ``errno`` variable is
+set appropriately.
+
+For more details see the :c:func:`poll()` manual page.
+
+
+Return Value
+============
+
+On success, :c:func:`poll()` returns the number structures which have
+non-zero ``revents`` fields, or zero if the call timed out. On error -1
+is returned, and the ``errno`` variable is set appropriately:
+
+``EBADF``
+    One or more of the ``ufds`` members specify an invalid file
+    descriptor.
+
+``EFAULT``
+    ``ufds`` references an inaccessible memory area.
+
+``EINTR``
+    The call was interrupted by a signal.
+
+``EINVAL``
+    The ``nfds`` argument is greater than ``OPEN_MAX``.

+
+Introduction
+============
+
+HDMI connectors provide a single pin for use by the Consumer Electronics
+Control protocol. This protocol allows different devices connected by an
+HDMI cable to communicate. The protocol for CEC version 1.4 is defined
+in supplements 1 (CEC) and 2 (HEAC or HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return
+Channel) of the HDMI 1.4a (:ref:`hdmi`) specification and the
+extensions added to CEC version 2.0 are defined in chapter 11 of the
+HDMI 2.0 (:ref:`hdmi2`) specification.
+
+The bitrate is very slow (effectively no more than 36 bytes per second)
+and is based on the ancient AV.link protocol used in old SCART
+connectors. The protocol closely resembles a crazy Rube Goldberg
+contraption and is an unholy mix of low and high level messages. Some
+messages, especially those part of the HEAC protocol layered on top of
+CEC, need to be handled by the kernel, others can be handled either by
+the kernel or by userspace.
+
+In addition, CEC can be implemented in HDMI receivers, transmitters and
+in USB devices that have an HDMI input and an HDMI output and that
+control just the CEC pin.
+
+Drivers that support CEC will create a CEC device node (/dev/cecX) to
+give userspace access to the CEC adapter. The
+:ref:`CEC_ADAP_G_CAPS` ioctl will tell userspace what it is allowed to do.
+
+In order to check the support and test it, it is suggested to download
+the `v4l-utils <https://git.linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git/>`_ package. It
+provides three tools to handle CEC:
+
+- cec-ctl: the Swiss army knife of CEC. Allows you to configure, transmit
+  and monitor CEC messages.
+
+- cec-compliance: does a CEC compliance test of a remote CEC device to
+  determine how compliant the CEC implementation is.
+
+- cec-follower: emulates a CEC follower.

+=========
+
+``fd``
+    File descriptor returned by :c:func:`open() <cec-open>`.
+
+``argp``
+    Pointer to struct :c:type:`cec_log_addrs`.
+
+Description
+===========
+
+To query the current CEC logical addresses, applications call
+:ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_G_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_G_LOG_ADDRS>` with a pointer to a
+struct :c:type:`cec_log_addrs` where the driver stores the logical addresses.
+
+To set new logical addresses, applications fill in
+struct :c:type:`cec_log_addrs` and call :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`
+with a pointer to this struct. The :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`
+is only available if ``CEC_CAP_LOG_ADDRS`` is set (the ``ENOTTY`` error code is
+returned otherwise). The :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`
+can only be called by a file descriptor in initiator mode (see :ref:`CEC_S_MODE`), if not
+the ``EBUSY`` error code will be returned.
+
+To clear existing logical addresses set ``num_log_addrs`` to 0. All other fields
+will be ignored in that case. The adapter will go to the unconfigured state.
+
+If the physical address is valid (see :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR <CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR>`),
+then this ioctl will block until all requested logical
+addresses have been claimed. If the file descriptor is in non-blocking mode then it will
+not wait for the logical addresses to be claimed, instead it just returns 0.
+
+A :ref:`CEC_EVENT_STATE_CHANGE <CEC-EVENT-STATE-CHANGE>` event is sent when the
+logical addresses are claimed or cleared.
+
+Attempting to call :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>` when
+logical address types are already defined will return with error ``EBUSY``.

+    * - __u16
+      - ``log_addr_mask``
+      - The bitmask of all logical addresses this adapter has claimed. If
+	this adapter is Unregistered then ``log_addr_mask`` sets bit 15
+	and clears all other bits. If this adapter is not configured at
+	all, then ``log_addr_mask`` is set to 0. Set by the driver.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``cec_version``
+      - The CEC version that this adapter shall use. See
+	:ref:`cec-versions`. Used to implement the
+	``CEC_MSG_CEC_VERSION`` and ``CEC_MSG_REPORT_FEATURES`` messages.
+	Note that :ref:`CEC_OP_CEC_VERSION_1_3A <CEC-OP-CEC-VERSION-1-3A>` is not allowed by the CEC
+	framework.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``num_log_addrs``
+      - Number of logical addresses to set up. Must be ≤
+	``available_log_addrs`` as returned by
+	:ref:`CEC_ADAP_G_CAPS`. All arrays in
+	this structure are only filled up to index
+	``available_log_addrs``-1. The remaining array elements will be
+	ignored. Note that the CEC 2.0 standard allows for a maximum of 2
+	logical addresses, although some hardware has support for more.
+	``CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS`` is 4. The driver will return the actual
+	number of logical addresses it could claim, which may be less than
+	what was requested. If this field is set to 0, then the CEC
+	adapter shall clear all claimed logical addresses and all other
+	fields will be ignored.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``vendor_id``
+      - The vendor ID is a 24-bit number that identifies the specific
+	vendor or entity. Based on this ID vendor specific commands may be
+	defined. If you do not want a vendor ID then set it to
+	``CEC_VENDOR_ID_NONE``.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``flags``
+      - Flags. See :ref:`cec-log-addrs-flags` for a list of available flags.
+    * - char
+      - ``osd_name[15]``
+      - The On-Screen Display name as is returned by the
+	``CEC_MSG_SET_OSD_NAME`` message.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``primary_device_type[CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS]``
+      - Primary device type for each logical address. See
+	:ref:`cec-prim-dev-types` for possible types.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``log_addr_type[CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS]``
+      - Logical address types. See :ref:`cec-log-addr-types` for
+	possible types. The driver will update this with the actual
+	logical address type that it claimed (e.g. it may have to fallback
+	to :ref:`CEC_LOG_ADDR_TYPE_UNREGISTERED <CEC-LOG-ADDR-TYPE-UNREGISTERED>`).
+    * - __u8
+      - ``all_device_types[CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS]``
+      - CEC 2.0 specific: the bit mask of all device types. See
+	:ref:`cec-all-dev-types-flags`. It is used in the CEC 2.0
+	``CEC_MSG_REPORT_FEATURES`` message. For CEC 1.4 you can either leave
+	this field to 0, or fill it in according to the CEC 2.0 guidelines to
+	give the CEC framework more information about the device type, even
+	though the framework won't use it directly in the CEC message.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``features[CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS][12]``
+      - Features for each logical address. It is used in the CEC 2.0
+	``CEC_MSG_REPORT_FEATURES`` message. The 12 bytes include both the
+	RC Profile and the Device Features. For CEC 1.4 you can either leave
+        this field to all 0, or fill it in according to the CEC 2.0 guidelines to
+        give the CEC framework more information about the device type, even

+Arguments
+=========
+
+``fd``
+    File descriptor returned by :c:func:`open() <cec-open>`.
+
+``argp``
+    Pointer to the CEC address.
+
+Description
+===========
+
+To query the current physical address applications call
+:ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_G_PHYS_ADDR <CEC_ADAP_G_PHYS_ADDR>` with a pointer to a __u16 where the
+driver stores the physical address.
+
+To set a new physical address applications store the physical address in
+a __u16 and call :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR <CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR>` with a pointer to
+this integer. The :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR <CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR>` is only available if
+``CEC_CAP_PHYS_ADDR`` is set (the ``ENOTTY`` error code will be returned
+otherwise). The :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR <CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR>` can only be called
+by a file descriptor in initiator mode (see :ref:`CEC_S_MODE`), if not
+the ``EBUSY`` error code will be returned.
+
+To clear an existing physical address use ``CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID``.
+The adapter will go to the unconfigured state.
+
+If logical address types have been defined (see :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`),
+then this ioctl will block until all
+requested logical addresses have been claimed. If the file descriptor is in non-blocking mode
+then it will not wait for the logical addresses to be claimed, instead it just returns 0.
+
+A :ref:`CEC_EVENT_STATE_CHANGE <CEC-EVENT-STATE-CHANGE>` event is sent when the physical address
+changes.
+
+The physical address is a 16-bit number where each group of 4 bits
+represent a digit of the physical address a.b.c.d where the most
+significant 4 bits represent 'a'. The CEC root device (usually the TV)
+has address 0.0.0.0. Every device that is hooked up to an input of the
+TV has address a.0.0.0 (where 'a' is ≥ 1), devices hooked up to those in
+turn have addresses a.b.0.0, etc. So a topology of up to 5 devices deep
+is supported. The physical address a device shall use is stored in the
+EDID of the sink.
+
+For example, the EDID for each HDMI input of the TV will have a
+different physical address of the form a.0.0.0 that the sources will
+read out and use as their physical address.

+
+Return Value
+============
+

+CEC devices can send asynchronous events. These can be retrieved by

+set errno to the ``EAGAIN`` error code.
+
+The internal event queues are per-filehandle and per-event type. If
+there is no more room in a queue then the last event is overwritten with
+the new one. This means that intermediate results can be thrown away but
+that the latest event is always available. This also means that is it
+possible to read two successive events that have the same value (e.g.
+two :ref:`CEC_EVENT_STATE_CHANGE <CEC-EVENT-STATE-CHANGE>` events with
+the same state). In that case the intermediate state changes were lost but
+it is guaranteed that the state did change in between the two events.

+
+Description
+===========
+
+By default any filehandle can use :ref:`CEC_TRANSMIT`, but in order to prevent
+applications from stepping on each others toes it must be possible to
+obtain exclusive access to the CEC adapter. This ioctl sets the
+filehandle to initiator and/or follower mode which can be exclusive
+depending on the chosen mode. The initiator is the filehandle that is
+used to initiate messages, i.e. it commands other CEC devices. The
+follower is the filehandle that receives messages sent to the CEC
+adapter and processes them. The same filehandle can be both initiator
+and follower, or this role can be taken by two different filehandles.
+
+When a CEC message is received, then the CEC framework will decide how
+it will be processed. If the message is a reply to an earlier
+transmitted message, then the reply is sent back to the filehandle that
+is waiting for it. In addition the CEC framework will process it.
+
+If the message is not a reply, then the CEC framework will process it
+first. If there is no follower, then the message is just discarded and a
+feature abort is sent back to the initiator if the framework couldn't
+process it. If there is a follower, then the message is passed on to the
+follower who will use :ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>` to dequeue
+the new message. The framework expects the follower to make the right
+decisions.
+
+The CEC framework will process core messages unless requested otherwise
+by the follower. The follower can enable the passthrough mode. In that
+case, the CEC framework will pass on most core messages without
+processing them and the follower will have to implement those messages.
+There are some messages that the core will always process, regardless of
+the passthrough mode. See :ref:`cec-core-processing` for details.
+
+If there is no initiator, then any CEC filehandle can use
+:ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>`. If there is an exclusive
+initiator then only that initiator can call
+:ref:`CEC_TRANSMIT`. The follower can of course
+always call :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>`.

+
+.. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, CEC_TRANSMIT, struct cec_msg *argp )
+    :name: CEC_TRANSMIT
+
+Arguments
+=========
+
+``fd``
+    File descriptor returned by :c:func:`open() <cec-open>`.
+
+``argp``
+    Pointer to struct cec_msg.
+
+Description
+===========
+
+To receive a CEC message the application has to fill in the
+``timeout`` field of struct :c:type:`cec_msg` and pass it to
+:ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>`.
+If the file descriptor is in non-blocking mode and there are no received
+messages pending, then it will return -1 and set errno to the ``EAGAIN``
+error code. If the file descriptor is in blocking mode and ``timeout``
+is non-zero and no message arrived within ``timeout`` milliseconds, then
+it will return -1 and set errno to the ``ETIMEDOUT`` error code.
+
+A received message can be:
+
+1. a message received from another CEC device (the ``sequence`` field will
+   be 0).
+2. the result of an earlier non-blocking transmit (the ``sequence`` field will
+   be non-zero).
+
+To send a CEC message the application has to fill in the struct
+:c:type:`cec_msg` and pass it to :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>`.
+The :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` is only available if
+``CEC_CAP_TRANSMIT`` is set. If there is no more room in the transmit
+queue, then it will return -1 and set errno to the ``EBUSY`` error code.
+The transmit queue has enough room for 18 messages (about 1 second worth
+of 2-byte messages). Note that the CEC kernel framework will also reply
+to core messages (see :ref:`cec-core-processing`), so it is not a good
+idea to fully fill up the transmit queue.
+
+If the file descriptor is in non-blocking mode then the transmit will
+return 0 and the result of the transmit will be available via
+:ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>` once the transmit has finished
+(including waiting for a reply, if requested).
+
+The ``sequence`` field is filled in for every transmit and this can be
+checked against the received messages to find the corresponding transmit
+result.
+
+Normally calling :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` when the physical
+address is invalid (due to e.g. a disconnect) will return ``ENONET``.
+
+However, the CEC specification allows sending messages from 'Unregistered' to
+'TV' when the physical address is invalid since some TVs pull the hotplug detect
+pin of the HDMI connector low when they go into standby, or when switching to
+another input.
+
+When the hotplug detect pin goes low the EDID disappears, and thus the
+physical address, but the cable is still connected and CEC still works.
+In order to detect/wake up the device it is allowed to send poll and 'Image/Text
+View On' messages from initiator 0xf ('Unregistered') to destination 0 ('TV').

+
+    * - __u64
+      - ``tx_ts``
+      - Timestamp in ns of when the last byte of the message was transmitted.
+	The timestamp has been taken from the ``CLOCK_MONOTONIC`` clock. To access
+	the same clock from userspace use :c:func:`clock_gettime`.
+    * - __u64
+      - ``rx_ts``
+      - Timestamp in ns of when the last byte of the message was received.
+	The timestamp has been taken from the ``CLOCK_MONOTONIC`` clock. To access
+	the same clock from userspace use :c:func:`clock_gettime`.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``len``
+      - The length of the message. For :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` this is filled in
+	by the application. The driver will fill this in for
+	:ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>`. For :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` it will be
+	filled in by the driver with the length of the reply message if ``reply`` was set.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``timeout``
+      - The timeout in milliseconds. This is the time the device will wait
+	for a message to be received before timing out. If it is set to 0,
+	then it will wait indefinitely when it is called by :ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>`.
+	If it is 0 and it is called by :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>`,
+	then it will be replaced by 1000 if the ``reply`` is non-zero or
+	ignored if ``reply`` is 0.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``sequence``
+      - A non-zero sequence number is automatically assigned by the CEC framework
+	for all transmitted messages. It is used by the CEC framework when it queues
+	the transmit result (when transmit was called in non-blocking mode). This
+	allows the application to associate the received message with the original
+	transmit.
+    * - __u32
+      - ``flags``
+      - Flags. See :ref:`cec-msg-flags` for a list of available flags.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``tx_status``
+      - The status bits of the transmitted message. See
+	:ref:`cec-tx-status` for the possible status values. It is 0 if
+	this messages was received, not transmitted.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``msg[16]``
+      - The message payload. For :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` this is filled in by the
+	application. The driver will fill this in for :ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>`.
+	For :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` it will be filled in by the driver with
+	the payload of the reply message if ``timeout`` was set.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``reply``
+      - Wait until this message is replied. If ``reply`` is 0 and the
+	``timeout`` is 0, then don't wait for a reply but return after
+	transmitting the message. Ignored by :ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>`.
+	The case where ``reply`` is 0 (this is the opcode for the Feature Abort
+	message) and ``timeout`` is non-zero is specifically allowed to make it
+	possible to send a message and wait up to ``timeout`` milliseconds for a
+	Feature Abort reply. In this case ``rx_status`` will either be set
+	to :ref:`CEC_RX_STATUS_TIMEOUT <CEC-RX-STATUS-TIMEOUT>` or
+	:ref:`CEC_RX_STATUS_FEATURE_ABORT <CEC-RX-STATUS-FEATURE-ABORT>`.
+
+	If the transmitter message is ``CEC_MSG_INITIATE_ARC`` then the ``reply``
+	values ``CEC_MSG_REPORT_ARC_INITIATED`` and ``CEC_MSG_REPORT_ARC_TERMINATED``
+	are processed differently: either value will match both possible replies.
+	The reason is that the ``CEC_MSG_INITIATE_ARC`` message is the only CEC
+	message that has two possible replies other than Feature Abort. The
+	``reply`` field will be updated with the actual reply so that it is
+	synchronized with the contents of the received message.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``rx_status``
+      - The status bits of the received message. See
+	:ref:`cec-rx-status` for the possible status values. It is 0 if
+	this message was transmitted, not received, unless this is the
+	reply to a transmitted message. In that case both ``rx_status``
+	and ``tx_status`` are set.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``tx_status``
+      - The status bits of the transmitted message. See

+	this, otherwise it is always 0. This counter is only valid if the
+	:ref:`CEC_TX_STATUS_ARB_LOST <CEC-TX-STATUS-ARB-LOST>` status bit is set.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``tx_nack_cnt``
+      - A counter of the number of transmit attempts that resulted in the
+	Not Acknowledged error. This is only set if the hardware supports
+	this, otherwise it is always 0. This counter is only valid if the
+	:ref:`CEC_TX_STATUS_NACK <CEC-TX-STATUS-NACK>` status bit is set.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``tx_low_drive_cnt``
+      - A counter of the number of transmit attempts that resulted in the
+	Arbitration Lost error. This is only set if the hardware supports
+	this, otherwise it is always 0. This counter is only valid if the
+	:ref:`CEC_TX_STATUS_LOW_DRIVE <CEC-TX-STATUS-LOW-DRIVE>` status bit is set.
+    * - __u8
+      - ``tx_error_cnt``
+      - A counter of the number of transmit errors other than Arbitration

+
+Return Value
+============
+
+On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
+appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
+:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
+
+The :ref:`ioctl CEC_RECEIVE <CEC_RECEIVE>` can return the following
+error codes:
+
+EAGAIN
+    No messages are in the receive queue, and the filehandle is in non-blocking mode.
+
+ETIMEDOUT
+    The ``timeout`` was reached while waiting for a message.
+
+ERESTARTSYS
+    The wait for a message was interrupted (e.g. by Ctrl-C).
+
+The :ref:`ioctl CEC_TRANSMIT <CEC_TRANSMIT>` can return the following
+error codes:
+
+ENOTTY
+    The ``CEC_CAP_TRANSMIT`` capability wasn't set, so this ioctl is not supported.
+
+EPERM
+    The CEC adapter is not configured, i.e. :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`
+    has never been called.
+
+ENONET
+    The CEC adapter is not configured, i.e. :ref:`ioctl CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS <CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS>`
+    was called, but the physical address is invalid so no logical address was claimed.
+    An exception is made in this case for transmits from initiator 0xf ('Unregistered')
+    to destination 0 ('TV'). In that case the transmit will proceed as usual.
+
+EBUSY
+    Another filehandle is in exclusive follower or initiator mode, or the filehandle
+    is in mode ``CEC_MODE_NO_INITIATOR``. This is also returned if the transmit
+    queue is full.
+
+EINVAL
+    The contents of struct :c:type:`cec_msg` is invalid.
+
+ERESTARTSYS
+    The wait for a successful transmit was interrupted (e.g. by Ctrl-C).

+ *
+ * - In autonomous mode, the dongle will by default reply Feature Abort

+ *   ID, and it will respond to at least one vendor specific command.
+ *
+ * - In autonomous mode, the dongle is known to attempt wakeup if it receives
+ *   <User Control Pressed> ["Power On"], ["Power] or ["Power Toggle"], or if it
+ *   receives <Set Stream Path> with its own physical address. It also does this
+ *   if it receives <Vendor Specific Command> [0x03 0x00] from an LG TV.

Subject: [PATCH 05/11] UPSTREAM: drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: add better clock disable
 control

The video setup path aways sets the clock disable register to a specific
value, which has the effect of disabling the CEC engine.  When we add the
CEC driver, this becomes a problem.

Fix this by only setting/clearing the bits that the video path needs to.

Subject: [PATCH 09/11] UPSTREAM: media: cec: Respond to unregistered
 initiators, when applicable

commit 845d6524d69b40bd6abd61dc1264a8657159aa55 upstream.

Running CEC 1.4 compliance test we get the following error on test
11.1.6.2: "ERROR: The DUT did not broadcast a
<Report Physical Address> message to the unregistered device."

Fix this by letting GIVE_PHYSICAL_ADDR message respond to unregistered
device. Also, GIVE_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID and GIVE_FEATURES fall in the
same category so, respond also to these messages.

With this fix we pass CEC 1.4 official compliance.
