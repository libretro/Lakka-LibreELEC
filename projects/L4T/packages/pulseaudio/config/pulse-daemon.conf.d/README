Files have to have the .conf file name extension, but otherwise the file names can be
chosen freely. The files under pulse-daemon.conf.d are processed in alphabetical order. 
In case the same option is set in multiple files, the last file to set an option 
overrides earlier files. The main daemon.conf file is processed first, so 
options set in files under pulse-daemon.conf.d override the main file.
