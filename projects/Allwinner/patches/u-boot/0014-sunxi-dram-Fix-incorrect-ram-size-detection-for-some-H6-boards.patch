Subject: [PATCH 1/1] sunxi: dram: Fix incorrect ram size detection for some H6
 boards
Date: Sun,  1 Oct 2023 21:43:32 +0530

On some H6 boards like Orange Pi 3 LTS, some times U-Boot fails to detect
ram size correctly. Instead of 2GB thats available, it detects 4GB of ram
and then SPL just hangs there making board not to boot further.

On debugging, I found that the rows value were being determined correctly,
but columns were sometimes off by one value. I found that adding some
delay after the mctl_core_init call along with making use of dsb in the
start of the mctl_mem_matches solves the issue.
